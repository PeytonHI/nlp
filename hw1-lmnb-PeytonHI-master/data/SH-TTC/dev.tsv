SH	‘What have I to do with sundials and papers?
SH	Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”
SH	“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”
SH	And on the morning of the wedding?”  “She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”
SH	“I am sorry to knock you up so early, [NAME],” said he, “but I have had a very serious accident during the night.
SH	I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.”
SH	It is probable.
SH	“Well, you can ask the [NAME] of [NAME], for all I care.
SH	Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands.
SH	I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two.
SH	It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine.
SH	Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”
SH	Have you followed me so far?”
SH	The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
SH	He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.
SH	“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau.
SH	“One moment,” [NAME] interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened.
SH	By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to [NAME] & [NAME], the well-known firm, of [NAME].
SH	“And what did you see?”
SH	This man strikes even deeper, but I think, [NAME], that we shall be able to strike deeper still.
SH	Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses.
SH	“Oh, yes; plenty.
SH	The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.
SH	very right!
SH	It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
SH	cried the prisoner passionately.
SH	Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.”
SH	It is likely that we should have gone on to [NAME] to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, [NAME] [NAME], came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that [NAME] was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.
SH	“Very naturally not.
SH	“Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?”
SH	Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’
SH	Heh?’  “‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.
SH	I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell.
SH	You had heard, [NAME], of this blue stone of the [NAME] of [NAME]’s?”
SH	“And now?”
SH	“The matter was perfectly simple.
SH	“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed.
SH	“Quite so.
SH	I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.
SH	“Witness: Nothing definite.
SH	“By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?
SH	Let’s have it straight, now.”
SH	He overdid it.
SH	Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
SH	“Yes, all.”  “[NAME] [NAME], you have not.
SH	Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above.
SH	Have you a family?’
SH	Can you not find the advertisement, [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around [NAME], the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.
SH	“I started off, [NAME] [NAME], but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] or [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting.
SH	He started me off upon the letter [NAME], and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me.
SH	“She is of a quiet nature.
SH	From that appointment he never came back alive.
SH	And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”
SH	Then [NAME] [NAME] pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.
SH	I suppose you know what you have got?”
SH	“Ah! yes, I see.
SH	He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
SH	[NAME] and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet.
SH	“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment.
SH	He had made a very considerable fortune in the [NAME], and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them.
SH	“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said [NAME]  “‘No excuse will avail,’ said [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else.
SH	But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.”
SH	“My cabby drove fast.
SH	“And who is her maid?”  “[NAME] is her name.
SH	The son, as far as he knew, was in [NAME].
SH	It was the band!
SH	He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
SH	The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.”
SH	I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house.
SH	Just read it out to me.”
SH	He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
SH	Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.”
SH	“He can’t lie in the street.
SH	She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”
SH	Here he comes.
SH	“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.
SH	“But with no very good result,” I remarked.
SH	Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.
SH	By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”
SH	At three o’clock precisely I was at [NAME] [NAME], but [NAME] had not yet returned.
SH	She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken [NAME] at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
SH	He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
SH	“Precisely.
SH	“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.
SH	“The [NAME]: I understand that the cry of ‘[NAME]’ was a common signal between you and your father?
SH	“There, now!”
SH	“Yes, at the mines.”
SH	At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a [NAME], who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.
SH	“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right.
SH	[NAME] stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
SH	“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.”
SH	He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.
SH	A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.
SH	I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.
SH	Let us now see the letter.
SH	He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink.
SH	“More than that.
SH	So [NAME] took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them.
SH	“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed.
SH	Besides, it is not I alone.
SH	“It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.
SH	In the latter, as may be remembered, [NAME] [NAME] was able, by winding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case.
SH	“It is solved.”
SH	“No, sir, [NAME] [NAME] is an Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat.
SH	It must have bled considerably.”
SH	“Why did you come to me?”
SH	I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in _
SH	“‘DEAR [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] has very kindly given me your  address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have  reconsidered your decision.
SH	I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.”
SH	Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.
SH	When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders.
SH	did I not tell you?”
SH	The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand.
SH	I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.
SH	It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it.
SH	By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital.
SH	“That is the baboon.”
SH	When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill.
SH	Its owner is unknown.
SH	I suppose there would be no chance of a train back.
SH	“I’ve heard that voice before,” said [NAME], staring down the dimly lit street.
SH	And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.
SH	“You have really got it!”
SH	“I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it.
SH	But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us.
SH	We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which [NAME] [NAME] had described.
SH	Do you not deduce something from that?”
SH	Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.”
SH	“Now then, [NAME] [NAME],” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop.
SH	“How often?”
SH	He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him.
SH	“Then I am your man.”
SH	He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
SH	The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”
SH	As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a [NAME] bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight.
SH	“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him.
SH	“[NAME]!” said [NAME], sinking back in deep thought.
SH	“‘That is very awkward.
SH	He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
SH	It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] is, sent the society’s warning to them.
SH	You just read it for yourself, [NAME].”
SH	But I have heard, [NAME] [NAME], that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart.
SH	“It is our French gold,” whispered the director.
SH	But I shall return by the twelve [NAME] train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”
SH	“Be it so,” said he.
SH	“I saw it in a paper,” explained the [NAME].
SH	His name is [NAME] [NAME], and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the [NAME].
SH	Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids.
SH	There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.
SH	I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
SH	“Kindly look her up in my index, [NAME],” murmured [NAME] without opening his eyes.
SH	I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be.
SH	Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
SH	“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.
SH	But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door.
SH	But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”
SH	They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.
SH	It was a chestnut.”
SH	“Here is my lens.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door.
SH	“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I had no time to think of it.”
SH	I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination.
SH	It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that.
SH	I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
SH	“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he.
SH	There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken.
SH	My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night.
SH	[NAME] stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.
SH	“How are you getting on?”
SH	“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a [NAME] present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word.
SH	“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship.
SH	“A client, then?”  “If so, it is a serious case.
SH	“It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”
SH	But I’ll go home with you.
SH	His knees were what I wished to see.
SH	here is her carriage at the door.”
SH	On account of the bequest of the late [NAME] [NAME], of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the [NAME] to a salary of [NAME] 4 a week for purely nominal services.
SH	In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a [NAME] rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
SH	“It is dated from [NAME] [NAME], written with a quill pen, and the noble [NAME] has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,” remarked [NAME] as he folded up the epistle.
SH	“I thought as much,” said he.
SH	“Not at all.
SH	These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of [NAME] carpet in the centre.
SH	I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.
SH	You seem to have done the thing very completely.
SH	Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”
SH	It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
SH	“I shall be at [NAME] [NAME] at ten.”
SH	“There has been some villainy here,” said [NAME]; “this beauty has guessed [NAME] [NAME]’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”
SH	I snatched it up and examined it.
SH	“You will leave that question in my hands.
SH	“‘Certainly,’ I answered.
SH	I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.”
SH	Here is something interesting!”
SH	“Was she in good spirits?”
SH	“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.”
SH	The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure.
SH	As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention.
SH	“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side.
SH	I have heard of you, [NAME] [NAME]; I have heard of you from [NAME] [NAME], whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.
SH	He had set the engine at work.
SH	“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp.
SH	You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”
SH	The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance.
SH	The facts are these: about four o’clock on [NAME] morning, [NAME], who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.
SH	Very retiring and gentlemanly he was.
SH	“The two [NAME] were seen after the time when [NAME] [NAME], the game-keeper, lost sight of them.
SH	“Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?
SH	“And did you observe any change in her then?”
SH	“I believe that he is coming here,” said [NAME], rubbing his hands.
SH	Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder.
SH	“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so.
SH	“This hat is three years old.
SH	“[NAME] so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, [NAME] [NAME] made his money.”  “Yes, certainly.”
SH	“You have a clue?”
SH	They were all engaged for the evening.”
SH	I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over.
SH	“We must sit without light.
SH	I shall look into the matter between this and then.
SH	“‘I quite follow you,’ said [NAME] ‘The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating [NAME]-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’
SH	The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.
SH	Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
SH	“How do you know that?”
SH	This is no time for despair.”
SH	“It is no ordinary one.”
SH	It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
SH	“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next.
SH	“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter.
SH	Could I not snap the bond?
SH	“I assure you, [NAME], without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
SH	All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, [NAME].
SH	“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
SH	If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”
SH	Give me your hand!
SH	Of these bedrooms the first is [NAME] [NAME]’s, the second my sister’s, and the third my own.
SH	The station-master laughed heartily.
SH	You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty.
SH	We called at the door, when the maid, at [NAME]’ request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.
SH	I didn’t know what to do.
SH	“Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.”
SH	“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”
SH	Was it not extraordinary?
SH	The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.
SH	“Quite so.
SH	“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue.
SH	it is too late—forever too late!
SH	It is thought that [NAME] decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”
SH	He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength.
SH	It is headed, ‘[NAME] [NAME] at a [NAME] Wedding’:  “‘The family of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding.
SH	He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him.
SH	“And when will you call?”
SH	If there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was [NAME] [NAME]’s friend too.
SH	I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”
SH	Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me.
SH	You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.
SH	“‘The ceremony, which was performed at [NAME] [NAME]’s, [NAME] [NAME], was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the [NAME] of [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Then we shall both come.
SH	A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
SH	“The next I heard of [NAME] was that he was in [NAME], and then he went prospecting in [NAME], and then I heard of him from [NAME] [NAME].
SH	He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
SH	The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you.
SH	“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said [NAME]
SH	He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of [NAME] that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.
SH	It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
SH	“‘Gone to the dealer’s, [NAME].’
SH	“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for [NAME] 25.
SH	“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at [NAME] 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still.
SH	It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.
SH	To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.
SH	“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time.
SH	He had turned his back so that none could see him but [NAME]
SH	“Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I remarked.
SH	“Come in!” said he.
SH	“We are on the outskirts of [NAME],” said my companion.
SH	There are not many in [NAME] which charge at that rate.
SH	She is my right hand.
SH	Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”
SH	Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window.
SH	“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight.
SH	“Yes, miss.
SH	Nothing of the sort.’
SH	[NAME] quivered with emotion.
SH	It is _the_ precious stone.”
SH	But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] and his wedding?”
SH	“Then pray send him home in it.
SH	I shall certainly do as you advise.”
SH	To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers.
SH	The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her.
SH	The [NAME] [NAME] is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge.
SH	I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
SH	You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered.
SH	Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards [NAME] [NAME].
SH	From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to [NAME].
SH	“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.”
SH	My wife is fond  of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear  such a dress indoors in the morning.
SH	“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.”  “Have you it here?”
SH	“He might have leaped back.
SH	There is that double possibility.
SH	“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”  “It must stop here, however,” said [NAME].
SH	he shrieked.
SH	It is only fair to them to say that.
SH	It is an old trick.”
SH	She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.
SH	“[NAME], no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person.
SH	“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told [NAME] and [NAME] my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client.
SH	“I fail to see that anyone is to blame.
SH	We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there!
SH	There is a date, you see, but no superscription except [NAME] [NAME], which is rather vague.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was already at breakfast when I came down.
SH	You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”
SH	Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer.
SH	I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.”
SH	The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.
SH	There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.”
SH	We both put our eyes to the grating.
SH	Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.
SH	Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.”
SH	“But they listened to my story with a smile.
SH	There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”
SH	There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of [NAME] [NAME] were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track.
SH	“Precisely so, on [NAME] 22nd, just five days ago.
SH	“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?”
SH	“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”
SH	My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from [NAME] [NAME], I got a few patients from among the officials.
SH	Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.
SH	The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller.
SH	Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door.
SH	A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
SH	‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable.
SH	“Yes, sir.
SH	I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.
SH	You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”
SH	“You were travelling in the [NAME]?”
SH	“Well, [NAME] [NAME], from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them.
SH	Would you mind reading me the advertised description of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	My guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.
SH	“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered, laughing.
SH	I glanced down.
SH	Oh, don’t bring it into court!
SH	“Then I must begin,” said he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.
SH	The man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree.
SH	“I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to [NAME].
SH	“It is clear that [NAME] [NAME] knows more about this matter than anyone else.”
SH	Just two months ago.”
SH	“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.”
SH	It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.
SH	Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.
SH	“Yes, to-day.”
SH	As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.
SH	With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
SH	“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”
SH	It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman.
SH	I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you.
SH	“Our quest is practically finished.
SH	“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.
SH	“They have but one retreat,” whispered [NAME].
SH	A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and [NAME].
SH	A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage.
SH	And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
SH	“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness.
SH	So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
SH	The will is very clear upon that point.
SH	“So I heard.
SH	Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of [NAME] [NAME], a goose and a black felt hat.
SH	We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in [NAME], passing over an angle of [NAME], and ending in [NAME].
SH	There are several singular points about the case.
SH	I distinctly saw his bare throat.”
SH	Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left.
SH	He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”
SH	“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady.
SH	“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”
SH	This stone is not yet twenty years old.
SH	“Then, for [NAME]’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?”
SH	It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.”
SH	I have never denied him a wish.
SH	“Here?”  “Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally.
SH	I heard his wife tell [NAME] [NAME] that she could do nothing with him.”
SH	We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in [NAME] [NAME], and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting.
SH	On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
SH	It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was [NAME] [NAME], and whose residence is near [NAME].
SH	“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed.
SH	Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.
SH	My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together.
SH	“This is my friend and colleague, [NAME] [NAME], who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] had not come back yet.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said [NAME] [NAME] serenely.
SH	“I am glad to hear you say so,” said [NAME] gravely.
SH	“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’
SH	Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red.
SH	“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.
SH	All will come well.
SH	I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me.
SH	“You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.”
SH	The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it.
SH	Had he lost his wife?”
SH	I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.”
SH	Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.
SH	“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait accompli_?”
SH	I was [NAME] [NAME]’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him.
SH	I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
SH	The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”
SH	I must go now, [NAME]; I have my dooties, just the same as you.”
SH	Kindly sign the paper where [NAME] [NAME] shows you.’
SH	I heard no more.
SH	“Thank you.
SH	I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”
SH	“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”
SH	Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.
SH	I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
SH	But what could it indicate?
SH	The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.
SH	What do you mean?”
SH	It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry.
SH	“It has been in some points a singular case,” said [NAME], flicking the horse on into a gallop.
SH	Hold it up to the light.”
SH	“It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.”
SH	I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.”
SH	“The best possible.”
SH	“Not yet.”
SH	As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
SH	At the time of the war he fought in [NAME]’s army, and afterwards under [NAME], where he rose to be a colonel.
SH	“No, I do not think so.
SH	“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”
SH	One mistake had been made in not arresting [NAME] instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the [NAME], but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him.
SH	I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night.
SH	“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger.
SH	His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as [NAME] [NAME] and much less amiable.
SH	I lay listening with all my ears.
SH	I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched.
SH	Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness.
SH	“And I to find an enemy.”
SH	“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.
SH	The man burst into a hearty laugh.
SH	Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
SH	“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered.
SH	“I believe I have the honour of addressing [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	She had hardly said the words when young [NAME] [NAME] came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper.
SH	Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.’
SH	“‘Where to?’  “‘To [NAME], in [NAME].
SH	There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen.
SH	As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint.
SH	And what do you think they found in the pockets?”
SH	If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves.
SH	But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good [NAME] beef would do him no harm.”
SH	To-day is [NAME], and I hope that by [NAME] we may come to a conclusion.”
SH	“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right.
SH	Air and scenery perfect.
SH	However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to [NAME], and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
SH	“Perfectly so.”
SH	And underneath?”  “‘Sold to [NAME] [NAME] of the [NAME], at 12_s_.’”
SH	She smiled, but there was no answering smile in [NAME]’ thin, eager face.
SH	“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did.
SH	“You seem to expect company.
SH	I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.
SH	I hate to meet her, [NAME], when I have no news of her husband.
SH	It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_ at the [NAME], and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
SH	You made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate [NAME]—and you managed that he should be the man sent for.
SH	He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman.
SH	“Well, I never!” said he.
SH	“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, [NAME] [NAME], especially [NAME] and [NAME] evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
SH	If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”
SH	For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason.
SH	“Murdered?”
SH	“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?”
SH	“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling.
SH	Now, what did you gather from that woman’s appearance?
SH	“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for [NAME], and I was feeling which was the fattest.’
SH	At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”
SH	“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”
SH	For my part, I should like all [NAME] and [NAME] to hear the rights of it.”
SH	That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
SH	“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is [NAME] [NAME].
SH	You know what woman’s instincts are.
SH	I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“The [NAME] press has not had very full accounts.
SH	A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?”
SH	I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion.
SH	In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there.
SH	He is round in the stable lane now.”
SH	There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
SH	But the note itself.
SH	This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject.
SH	The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour.
SH	This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
SH	Give him a dash of brandy.
SH	Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
SH	When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the [NAME], so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house.
SH	“It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.
SH	“What has she been saying to you?”
SH	It was a wild night.
SH	The old man sank his face in his hands.
SH	You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the [NAME], and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”
SH	I shall call with the [NAME] to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us.
SH	During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from [NAME] rather than from the schoolmaster.
SH	All was as we had seen it in the daytime.
SH	Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in [NAME], I should never have had a fear for her.
SH	There is no sign of any other weapon.”
SH	Shall be glad if you will come with me.
SH	Let me know your train.
SH	“If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”  [NAME].
SH	“I believe, [NAME] [NAME], that you have already made up your mind,” said [NAME] [NAME], laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.
SH	What do you want?”
SH	“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
SH	“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it.
SH	“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’
SH	You will ask me why I did not dispose of it?
SH	In the case of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] it was of use to me, and also in the [NAME] [NAME] business.
SH	Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
SH	“Oh, you must not discourage me, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Pray do so.
SH	I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
SH	But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it.
SH	It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’
SH	There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men.
SH	“They are never sold upon hats.
SH	“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business.
SH	“Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”  [NAME].
SH	“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them.
SH	The question was hardly out of my mouth, and [NAME] had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.
SH	“That was it,” said [NAME], nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of it.
SH	“I am immensely indebted to you.
SH	As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.
SH	“Certainly,” said [NAME], stepping over and turning the key in the door.
SH	But the deception could not be kept up forever.
SH	You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by [NAME] [NAME], of [NAME] [NAME], to a salesman named [NAME], by him in turn to [NAME] [NAME], of the [NAME], and by him to his club, of which [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] is a member.”
SH	“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.
SH	“Do you think that this man [NAME] is innocent?”
SH	“What is it, then—a fire?”
SH	By the way, [NAME], I shall want your co-operation.”
SH	“It is no time for me to hide anything.
SH	Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested.
SH	I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child.
SH	My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month.
SH	I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, [NAME], though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”
SH	“Why, what do you mean?”
SH	It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.
SH	“When did she vanish, then?”
SH	A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury.
SH	I have come _[NAME]_
SH	“You may address me as the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], a Bohemian nobleman.
SH	With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
SH	“There were none.
SH	We waited long for news of the _[NAME] [NAME]_ of [NAME], but none ever reached us.
SH	“My dear [NAME]!”
SH	Was [NAME]-[NAME] for the colonies in a late administration.
SH	She is what we call in [NAME] a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions.
SH	“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one.
SH	“Well, down they came to the [NAME] country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.
SH	When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart.
SH	I have no idea what she meant.”
SH	“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.”
SH	Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies.
SH	[NAME] passed his tongue over his parched lips.
SH	Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove [NAME] [NAME] to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.”
SH	She had married a man named [NAME], and lived in [NAME] [NAME], where she fattened fowls for the market.
SH	The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
SH	“Not at all.
SH	He put his hand over part of the map.
SH	“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister [NAME] and I had no great pleasure in our lives.
SH	“You are the first who have ever heard my story.
SH	“You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.”
SH	He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
SH	“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”
SH	Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of [NAME] [NAME] would have failed to recognise him.
SH	‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’
SH	“It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.
SH	Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success.
SH	“‘Very good.’
SH	From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to [NAME] in the case of the [NAME] murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the [NAME] brothers at [NAME], and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of [NAME].
SH	“In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,” said he.
SH	Indeed, from the direction of the [NAME] [NAME] no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
SH	“‘Dearest do not be frightened.
SH	“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.
SH	“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”
SH	We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans.
SH	“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner.
SH	When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.
SH	“None at all.
SH	“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”
SH	“Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me angry to see the easy way in which [NAME] [NAME]—that is, my father—took it all.
SH	It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones.
SH	“That is well.
SH	I have no doubt that I am myself to blame.
SH	“Yes, sir.
SH	I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take.
SH	She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from [NAME] [NAME] for the [NAME].”
SH	Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give.
SH	“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn.
SH	It had only lain there a few days.
SH	The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
SH	I wish she had been of my own station!
SH	Look at the neat little ‘[NAME] [NAME]’ at the bottom.
SH	His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“There is one thing,” said [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”
SH	He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
SH	The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it.
SH	He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end.
SH	Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the [NAME] [NAME], with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.
SH	[NAME], for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink.
SH	It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
SH	There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.
SH	“‘What would be the hours?’
SH	Why, [NAME], let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them.
SH	“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said [NAME]
SH	The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
SH	With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.”
SH	[NAME] help me!”
SH	It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear.
TTC	The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn.
TTC	I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.”
TTC	“And mind you!” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.
TTC	The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,” observed the [NAME], “will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts out the sky.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when [NAME] [NAME] looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.
TTC	“Yes, madame,” answered [NAME] [NAME]; “this is our poor prisoner’s [NAME] daughter, and only child.”
TTC	“But he has been--been found.
TTC	I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it.
TTC	“And as such,” quoth [NAME] [NAME], whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--“as such I will appeal to [NAME] [NAME], to break up this conference and order us all to our homes.
TTC	He had loved [NAME] [NAME] from the hour of his danger.
TTC	O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.”
TTC	She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
TTC	Besides these [NAME], were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about “the [NAME] of [NAME]:” holding that [NAME] had got out of the [NAME] of [NAME]--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got out of the [NAME], and that he was to be kept from flying out of the [NAME], and was even to be shoved back into the [NAME], by fasting and seeing of spirits.
TTC	This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound.
TTC	He embraced her, solemnly commended her to [NAME], and humbly thanked [NAME] for having bestowed her on him.
TTC	“I don’t feel disposed to say much.
TTC	So, the time came for him to bid [NAME] good night, and they separated.
TTC	For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.
TTC	The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors.
TTC	“I am sometimes.”
TTC	“I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her face.
TTC	“See to it, [NAME].
TTC	“There, there, there!
TTC	“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said [NAME] [NAME], with signs of angry apprehension.
TTC	“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one.
TTC	“Again, well?
TTC	“It is Defarge,” said madame.
TTC	The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful.
TTC	It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way.
TTC	I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched.
TTC	The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous.
TTC	He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself.
TTC	It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the [NAME] of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by [NAME], to conduct the happy chocolate to [NAME]’s lips.
TTC	But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled [NAME] [NAME]; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, [NAME] [NAME] was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.
TTC	from the universal throat again.
TTC	I will remember it as long as I live.”
TTC	The latent uneasiness in [NAME]’s mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter.
TTC	“I forgot it long ago.”
TTC	The two hands of [NAME] [NAME] buffeted and tore her face; but, [NAME] [NAME], with her head down, held her round the waist, and [NAME] to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.
TTC	For such variety of reasons, [NAME]’s was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of [NAME] [NAME]; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that [NAME]’s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the [NAME] windows, for all who ran through [NAME] [NAME] to read.
TTC	He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage.
TTC	“What then, my gentle sister?”  “Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: “that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”
TTC	Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too.
TTC	His manner and his look quite terrified them all.
TTC	“My father,” exclaimed [NAME], “you are ill!”
TTC	But they were very decently kept.
TTC	That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or [NAME], any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off.
TTC	“Touch then!”
TTC	It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and [NAME] [NAME] knew enough of its antecedents to know better.
TTC	He was shown up-stairs, and found [NAME] at her work, alone.
TTC	I shall be more happy to execute it.”
TTC	Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another.
TTC	“If I don’t, you’ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that gentleman, shaking his head; “that’s questions enough for you; I ain’t a going out, till you’ve been long abed.”
TTC	You have business before you; useful business.
TTC	Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you.”
TTC	“Oh, [NAME], dear [NAME]!” cried [NAME] [NAME], clapping her hands again.
TTC	My [NAME] (perhaps with [NAME] [NAME] on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself.
TTC	“You do not find it easy to advise me?” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	It was my way, I suppose.”
TTC	“How?”  “Good evening.”
TTC	Let the bearer see his wife.”
TTC	“Don’t be afraid to hear me.
TTC	From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his [NAME]_ daughter?
TTC	“Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”
TTC	They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.
TTC	A man don’t see all this here a goin’ on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that, without havin’ his serious thoughts of things.
TTC	He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent [NAME] [NAME] clean out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them.
TTC	But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.
TTC	It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.
TTC	I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy.
TTC	At last, when he appealed by name to [NAME] [NAME], an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the [NAME] declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the [NAME] were content to receive them.
TTC	And there he shook his head, and stopped.
TTC	“Well, well,” reasoned [NAME], “but one must stop somewhere.
TTC	He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he was clear of the [NAME] [NAME]; for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion.  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I forget what you were accused of?”  “[NAME].
TTC	In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me.
TTC	You will help me to see him if you can?”
TTC	“[NAME], tut!” said [NAME] [NAME]; “what is this despondency in the brave little breast?
TTC	“Speak out, you know.”
TTC	The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly uncertain condition.
TTC	“That’s right, that’s right.
TTC	“You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll.
TTC	So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that [NAME] [NAME] seemed to stand in a company of the dead.
TTC	I have seen with my eyes.”
TTC	All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of [NAME] and freedom.
TTC	“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be cautious,” said [NAME] [NAME]; “but I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets.
TTC	In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress.
TTC	A strong card--a certain [NAME] card!
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides.
TTC	He will tell you all.
TTC	I must not urge them too much; it would rouse suspicion.”
TTC	It was so very long ago.”
TTC	Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and [NAME].
TTC	What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here.
TTC	“[NAME] knows we don’t,” returned [NAME] [NAME], “but have no fear for me.
TTC	“Good day, citizen.”
TTC	But, [NAME] [NAME] suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house.
TTC	Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount.
TTC	A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it.
TTC	“I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!”
TTC	The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], look upon the prisoner.
TTC	“[NAME] as good stead to-morrow as to-day.
TTC	Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a [NAME].  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Yes?” said the [NAME], with evident constraint.
TTC	He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy.
TTC	“See!” said the [NAME] of [NAME], raising his hand towards the moon.
TTC	All very bad, very bad!”
TTC	“The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty.
TTC	He didn’t call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious.
TTC	“You have a husband, madame?”
TTC	If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the [NAME], when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world.
TTC	A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself.
TTC	Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference.
TTC	But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and [NAME] [NAME] looked in vain for the fulfilment of [NAME] [NAME]’s prediction.
TTC	the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.
TTC	When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my father’s.”
TTC	“This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her.
TTC	But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, [NAME] came downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears, beforehand.
TTC	“You will see.
TTC	What is it?”
TTC	He raised them, and saw her face.
TTC	The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid!
TTC	“Why am I confined alone?”
TTC	He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.
TTC	He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved [NAME].
TTC	Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done.
TTC	But, [NAME] [NAME] replied to my [NAME], no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more.
TTC	“Not much.
TTC	Like the fabled rustic who raised the [NAME] with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the [NAME] no question, but immediately fled; so, [NAME], after boldly reading the [NAME]’s [NAME] backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the [NAME] [NAME], no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.
TTC	“What has gone wrong?” said [NAME], calmly looking out.
TTC	Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!
TTC	I can scarcely believe it now.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it.
TTC	In [NAME], he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he would not have prospered.
TTC	“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said [NAME] [NAME], striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it is best that [NAME] [NAME] should have it entirely under her own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”
TTC	But the shadow of the manner of these [NAME] was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.
TTC	“She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, ‘It is for thine own dear sake.
TTC	I have gone aside from my purpose; I was speaking about our being friends.
TTC	Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance.
TTC	“Listen to him!”
TTC	The clearance was effected at last; the [NAME] arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until [NAME] should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.
TTC	The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child’s head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.
TTC	The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”
TTC	[NAME] bless you!”
TTC	The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.
TTC	A rose lay beside her, and if she now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air.
TTC	As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.
TTC	He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother. [NAME], father!”
TTC	You are not afraid?”
TTC	And now that the cloud settled on [NAME] [NAME], which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last.
TTC	[NAME], if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don’t kneel!
TTC	Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day.”
TTC	Everybody was dressed for a [NAME] [NAME] that was never to leave off.
TTC	And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!
TTC	What weakness is this, my dear!
TTC	“I believe so.”
TTC	I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my [NAME].
TTC	The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.
TTC	And off _her_ head comes!
TTC	“I, my Pross?” (By this time, [NAME] [NAME] dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.)
TTC	I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day.”
TTC	“[NAME] if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said [NAME] [NAME], more and more disturbed.
TTC	“Business seems bad?”
TTC	Ever borrow money of the prisoner?
TTC	I am a disappointed drudge, sir.
TTC	He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the [NAME]; I have timely information.
TTC	“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”
TTC	The rest of his time he passed in [NAME].
TTC	Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.
TTC	As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly saw his way to the verdict.
TTC	Not one of them would harm you.”
TTC	The [NAME] was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling [NAME] [NAME] how she spoilt [NAME], in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as [NAME] [NAME] had, and would have had more if it were possible.
TTC	Although [NAME] [NAME], through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was pleased to call it) than [NAME] [NAME] did.
TTC	I only want your authority.
TTC	“It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of [NAME] [NAME] here.”
TTC	How many more of them!”
TTC	She was thrown into a transport by the tidings [NAME] [NAME] gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.
TTC	See my saw!
TTC	“Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you?
TTC	They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in [NAME], showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the [NAME] himself.
TTC	We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge.
TTC	“[NAME], man, with whom I have exchanged.
TTC	It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was [NAME] [NAME]: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap.
TTC	Six tumbrils carry the day’s wine to [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“At what hour did he come on board?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
TTC	“You heard me say why, a minute ago.
TTC	It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous.
TTC	“Never you mind what it is!”
TTC	“I don’t hear you,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Are you astonished?”
TTC	The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done.
TTC	“I entreat you to tell me more, [NAME].”
TTC	“The road is clear, my dearest.
TTC	The [NAME] looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”
TTC	He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to [NAME]’s and take leave of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I will go,” said [NAME] [NAME], “to the [NAME] and the [NAME] straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name.
TTC	May He have mercy on all who are in danger!”
TTC	“[NAME] it again, and write what I shall dictate.
TTC	His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that [NAME] [NAME] hesitated.
TTC	Straining his powers of listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm.
TTC	“Oh, father, I should so like to be a [NAME]-[NAME] when I’m quite growed up!”
TTC	For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence.
TTC	Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then for [NAME]!”
TTC	It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to [NAME], there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the [NAME], [NAME], had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the [NAME].
TTC	“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked [NAME] [NAME], with natural hesitation.
TTC	There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like *
TTC	And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.
TTC	That, he had been the prisoner’s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country.
TTC	When it fell dark again, [NAME] [NAME] asked him as before:  “[NAME] Doctor, will you go out?”
TTC	Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of [NAME], [NAME] stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.
TTC	As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, [NAME] [NAME] saw him shrink into the exact figure that [NAME] had had in keeping.
TTC	Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.”
TTC	Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on [NAME] [NAME]’s [NAME] like a man who had done with it.
TTC	“‘How long,’ I asked, ‘has this lasted?’
TTC	“Now are you content?”
TTC	A parting blessing for our child.”
TTC	At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in [NAME] [NAME]’s room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety.
TTC	“I play my [NAME], [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the [NAME] servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.
TTC	“I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely.
TTC	Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and [NAME] without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.
TTC	“Come in, come in!”
TTC	The [NAME], in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”  “Nine days and nights.”
TTC	In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.
TTC	He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one.
TTC	A numerous medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through the barrier very slowly.
TTC	There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:  “I believe it.
TTC	“It is all I could do,” said [NAME].
TTC	Please to let me know.”
TTC	It was curious.
TTC	A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
TTC	There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to [NAME].”
TTC	[NAME] help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the same low voice.
TTC	Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”
TTC	He said he had been with [NAME] until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment.
TTC	The door closed, and [NAME] was left alone.
TTC	“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife.
TTC	[NAME], you know what a brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”
TTC	“Show it me!”
TTC	Much better,” said [NAME], not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the [NAME].”
TTC	As [NAME] [NAME], thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the [NAME], [NAME] [NAME] added to himself: “[NAME], you honest tradesman, there’s hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”
TTC	*****  “I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips.
TTC	“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday.
TTC	“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said [NAME], “and me and my partners suffer.
TTC	“It is she,” observed her husband.
TTC	“I began to think,” said [NAME] [NAME], pushing his brown wig back, “that I should have to pass the night at [NAME]’s.
TTC	In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.
TTC	Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel.
TTC	But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth.
TTC	“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads.
TTC	“But what did I know?
TTC	I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.
TTC	For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a [NAME] courtyard, and even to a [NAME] over the counter?
TTC	“Why do you write in the public streets?
TTC	I never doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper.
TTC	So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils.
TTC	What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us!
TTC	I have by no means forgotten it, and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”
TTC	“If it had pleased _[NAME]_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them.
TTC	The [NAME] turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile:  “My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city.
TTC	You was a spy--witness at the [NAME].
TTC	Ever live by play?
TTC	“Oh dear me!”
TTC	I have observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days.
TTC	I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
TTC	I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him?
TTC	[NAME], to secure his good will, she always spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.
TTC	In this age, he would have been a [NAME]; in that age, he was a Tutor.
TTC	“Marvellous cognac this, madame!”
TTC	At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons.
TTC	“Who are you?”
TTC	“Do you [NAME]”
TTC	“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took another bite.
TTC	So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which [NAME] [NAME] felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken place yesterday.
TTC	They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.
TTC	He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms.
TTC	“It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,” returned [NAME]; “you ought to be much obliged to me.”
TTC	O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?”
TTC	“I must bear it, if you let it in.”
TTC	The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced.
TTC	Ah [NAME] heretofore the [NAME], I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of [NAME] known at [NAME]!
TTC	His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.
TTC	I’m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking.
TTC	“That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated.
TTC	Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife.
TTC	It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner.
TTC	But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.
TTC	Apparently, [NAME] [NAME] did, to judge from his looks.
TTC	“What’s on?”
TTC	He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off.
TTC	“I am accustomed to it.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o’clock.
TTC	“_I_ don’t think I do,” said [NAME].
TTC	Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said [NAME] [NAME]; “I’ll do that for you.”
TTC	“What is his name?” said [NAME] [NAME], with his open pocket-book in his hand.
TTC	“A bad business this, madame, of [NAME]’s execution.
TTC	He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which [NAME] [NAME] could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.
TTC	That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.
TTC	“Not if to lift this glass would do it!
TTC	The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off.
TTC	A footstep in the snow.
TTC	When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation.
TTC	“You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend’s answer, delivered in no very soothing tone.
TTC	To be suffocated?”
TTC	[NAME] still had his hand in his breast.
TTC	cried the audience.
TTC	Which is he?”
TTC	[NAME] sat by her father; [NAME] sat beside her; [NAME] leaned against a window.
TTC	So now let’s look at you.”
TTC	“Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the [NAME] [NAME] had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of [NAME] and [NAME].
TTC	“That I will, and readily,” said [NAME] [NAME], “if it is not dangerous.”
TTC	“When you began it--”  “_I_ began it, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow.
TTC	She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting.
TTC	[NAME]’s [NAME] had a run upon it in the mail.
TTC	[NAME] was to be married to-morrow.
TTC	“That at least is true,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Hurry, hurry!”
TTC	“As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,” said [NAME] [NAME] to herself; “and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”
TTC	Still, the [NAME], with shaded [NAME], beat his foot nervously on the ground.
TTC	“I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire.
TTC	He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of [NAME] an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.
TTC	Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two.
TTC	You don’t know him,” said the spy, quickly.
TTC	His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of [NAME] shining on him.
TTC	They were all by that time choking the [NAME] of [NAME] where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets.
TTC	He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have.
TTC	“[NAME], I thank you indeed.
TTC	The [NAME] and the [NAME], looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.
TTC	There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.
TTC	*****  “These scraps of paper fail me.
TTC	That warn’t your name over the water.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the [NAME] [NAME] women.
TTC	Had_ he reason?”
TTC	“I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?”
TTC	“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother [NAME], “I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.
TTC	As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her, they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago.
TTC	“I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	My [NAME] being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable.
TTC	He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed.”
TTC	[NAME], her child.
TTC	Never in a debtors’ prison?
TTC	His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that [NAME] [NAME] caught the flame, and was as quick as youth.
TTC	“And your duties here have drawn to an end, [NAME]?” said [NAME], turning to him.
TTC	As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at [NAME] [NAME] and at [NAME], some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him.
TTC	“The secret cells!”
TTC	For the love of the great [NAME]!
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.
TTC	“Is sought by any other suitor?”
TTC	[NAME] dig, [NAME] hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.”
TTC	They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself.
TTC	No man’s life here is worth purchase.
TTC	[NAME], [NAME] [NAME], in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!
TTC	These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard.
TTC	“Rot the admiration of the whole [NAME]!
TTC	After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, [NAME] attracted the notice of [NAME] [NAME], who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
TTC	“Come, then!”
TTC	“Buried how long?”  “Almost eighteen years.”
TTC	He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept down and perverted, that [NAME] [NAME] wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her.
TTC	“Not for use?”  “That depends.
TTC	“What’s that to you?
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME]!” croaked [NAME] [NAME], as he read greedily.
TTC	Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!
TTC	He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth.
TTC	The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor.
TTC	“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good day!”
TTC	She could never deliver me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.
TTC	[NAME] had been out at a little supper last night, where the [NAME] and the [NAME] [NAME] were charmingly represented.
TTC	Advancing his hand by little and little, he took it up and looked at it.
TTC	Just as I am getting on!”
TTC	The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
TTC	But he lies [NAME], under a little heap of poor grass.”
TTC	I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the [NAME] [NAME]-seat.
TTC	The standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the [NAME] [NAME], you inside there!”
TTC	“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“For instance--”  “For instance,” returned [NAME] [NAME], composedly, “shrouds.”
TTC	Which is he?”
TTC	“Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”
TTC	[NAME] in the court!
TTC	But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] himself, and pulled him off the bench.
TTC	It was somewhere here?’
TTC	“If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”  “Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”  “[NAME] [NAME],” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] saw losing cards in it that [NAME] [NAME] knew nothing of.
TTC	The only ray of hope that [NAME] [NAME] could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked.
TTC	He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed [NAME] in with most inappropriate difficulty.
TTC	Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very new and agreeable.
TTC	Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much.”
TTC	Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode.
TTC	[NAME] was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men.
TTC	“Were there any other passengers in the mail?”
TTC	“I am going,” said [NAME] [NAME], leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	No other man in all this [NAME] could have done what he has done for me.”
TTC	He wrote a long letter to [NAME], showing her that he had known nothing of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read.
TTC	There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of [NAME]; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of [NAME].
TTC	“No, my dear, not ill.
TTC	“The door is locked then, my friend?” said [NAME] [NAME], surprised.
TTC	That, presented by his conductors to this [NAME], he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the [NAME]; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge.
TTC	Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear the echoes about which you have your theory.”
TTC	His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in [NAME]’s hands.
TTC	What are you hooroaring at?
TTC	“Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one.
TTC	Truly it is against rule.
TTC	Who brought her father to life?”
TTC	Let us look at his infamous name.
TTC	On this certain fine [NAME], [NAME] [NAME] walked towards [NAME], early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit.
TTC	It was prevalent everywhere.
TTC	If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”
TTC	They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers.
TTC	As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers.
TTC	“I communicate to him that secret.
TTC	It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last from [NAME].”
TTC	[NAME] the [NAME] ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.
TTC	At every vote (the [NAME] voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause.
TTC	All here, yourself excepted, saw the [NAME] take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the [NAME].
TTC	It was dark when [NAME] [NAME] left him, and it was an hour later and darker when [NAME] came home; she hurried into the room alone--for [NAME] [NAME] had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty.
TTC	The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom.
TTC	The secret was well kept, and [NAME] was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.
TTC	The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.
TTC	He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.
TTC	“But it’s not my business!”
TTC	“What did you say?”
TTC	If he had given any utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:  “I see [NAME], and [NAME], [NAME], The [NAME], the [NAME], the [NAME], long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use.
TTC	Ecod!” growled [NAME] [NAME], “it’s you I have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
TTC	No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged.
TTC	Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope.
TTC	They were armed.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
TTC	So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.
TTC	“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder.
TTC	“I hope you care to live?”
TTC	“Look at me!”
TTC	That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done.
TTC	“--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her sake, [NAME] will keep her husband out of [NAME].”
TTC	He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given information.
TTC	“They are not in danger?”
TTC	He don’t get no iron rust here!”  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Put it on, put it on,” said the other.
TTC	“[NAME] Manette--”  “Is well,” said the [NAME], as he stopped short, “and your return will delight us all.
TTC	The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to [NAME], to say with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born, and called [NAME] [NAME], why did you come to [NAME]?”
TTC	“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return.
TTC	“It is hard for me to speak of her at any time.
TTC	A [NAME]  When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	When I ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here.
TTC	Do you call _that_ being a [NAME]?”
TTC	“I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], “and I’ll do it.
TTC	Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting.
TTC	“I am saying nothing.”
TTC	Towards [NAME], therefore, [NAME] [NAME] shouldered his way from the [NAME], while the bloom of the [NAME] [NAME]’s infancy was still upon it.
TTC	I took it from his hand, but laid it on the table.
TTC	You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to [NAME] [NAME] long before I can.”
TTC	cried [NAME] [NAME], rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously.
TTC	A [NAME] at the [NAME]  “I have saved him.”
TTC	Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer.”
TTC	“Bring your chair here, and speak on.”
TTC	I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
TTC	With this on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he arrived at the prison of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time.
TTC	The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] took it in his hand.
TTC	He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling.
TTC	Pray, pray, be cautious!”
TTC	When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: [NAME] struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel [NAME], burning at the stake and contending with the fire.
TTC	“[NAME], aristocrat!”
TTC	The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.
TTC	It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it.
TTC	“You are the fellow we want,” said [NAME], in his ear; “you make these fools believe that it will last for ever.
TTC	I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration.
TTC	Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’
TTC	[NAME] put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] beckoned the [NAME] and The [NAME] a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:  “She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death.
TTC	[NAME]--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.
TTC	Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke.
TTC	How the virtuous servant, [NAME], was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in [NAME], he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the [NAME]--though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose.
TTC	Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
TTC	These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment.
TTC	In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear.
TTC	The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”
TTC	“What is it in your hand?”
TTC	But, keep in the way.
TTC	In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river.
TTC	“Of course, it has been kept for you.”
TTC	“Her husband’s destiny,” said [NAME] [NAME], with her usual composure, “will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is to end him.
TTC	Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at [NAME] [NAME], he heard One struck away from him, without surprise.
TTC	“What!” said [NAME] [NAME], looking out of bed for a boot.
TTC	She laid her head upon her father’s breast, as she had laid his poor head on her own breast, long, long ago.
TTC	And look here!
TTC	You are engaged at three o’clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.--You?”
TTC	[NAME], as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him to remain quite still.
TTC	No, he scorned the base insinuation.
TTC	[NAME] could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his [NAME] catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”
TTC	“At last it is come, my dear!”
TTC	“[NAME]-a-a-business, business!”
TTC	Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, “They have come back!” and sat listening.
TTC	There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation.
TTC	“[NAME] knows it is a shame!”
TTC	“The citizeness is superb!”
TTC	Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead.
TTC	“How can you say that?
TTC	The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated [NAME] [NAME] with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of [NAME], like that tutor-fellow.
TTC	Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient.
TTC	You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?”
TTC	The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.
TTC	“I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.”
TTC	What is it?”
TTC	[NAME] enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
TTC	The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.
TTC	“Ah, what a pity!
TTC	Going a fishing.”
TTC	“We shall not see the triumph.”
TTC	“I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred.
TTC	A gentleman and lady.
TTC	He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without [NAME], having seen him; and replied:  “My child, you did see him, and it is [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME] love you, [NAME] shouldn’t,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although [NAME] [NAME] would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to [NAME] in that humble capacity.
TTC	“‘Not dead,’ said I; ‘but like to die.’
TTC	I should like to know how you speed; though, mind!
TTC	Whereupon, [NAME] [NAME] did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself.
TTC	“I would not keep it,” said [NAME] [NAME], shaking his head; for he gained in firmness as he saw the [NAME] disquieted.
TTC	He now gave me a rouleau of gold.
TTC	Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing.
TTC	He felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old [NAME] morning conversation with [NAME] [NAME], and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days, he knew that he must face it.
TTC	[NAME], mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody’s life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the footsteps raging in [NAME] [NAME] afar off, as the little circle sat in the dark [NAME] window.
TTC	[NAME] has an assignation elsewhere.
TTC	We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held no correspondence.”
TTC	“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.
TTC	“In [NAME], for example?”  “Yes.
TTC	On a night in [NAME][NAME][NAME], one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, [NAME] [NAME] came in late, from [NAME]’s, and sat himself down by [NAME] and her husband in the dark window.
TTC	[NAME] should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt.
TTC	“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated.
TTC	No, I was not a shoemaker by trade.
TTC	“Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?”  “About.”  “About.
TTC	“I seek him.
TTC	It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the [NAME] [NAME] which shaved close: who kissed [NAME] [NAME], looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack.
TTC	The door of the [NAME]’s room opened, and he came out with [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The English customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission.
TTC	He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he promised.
TTC	What money would be drawn out of [NAME]’s henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in [NAME]’s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with [NAME]’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] could, though he thought heavily of these questions.
TTC	She had reserved this last evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.
TTC	[NAME] terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with his outer coat; “But you,” said [NAME] [NAME], reverting to the theme, “you are young.”
TTC	His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again.
TTC	They went out, leaving [NAME], and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire.
TTC	“‘For his sake, [NAME],’ she said, pointing to him in tears, ‘I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can.
TTC	Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?”
TTC	He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over.”
TTC	He, therefore, made haste to say:
TTC	Is [NAME] was the good creature’s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance [NAME] there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”
TTC	Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night.
TTC	Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands.
TTC	How you start!”
TTC	No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance.
TTC	His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again.
TTC	Don’t let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.
TTC	It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.
TTC	Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar.
TTC	“If you hear in my voice--I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it!
TTC	Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”
TTC	“Where does my father get all that iron rust from?
TTC	One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out.
TTC	Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine.
TTC	“Inform the [NAME] of what you did that day within the [NAME], citizen.”
TTC	“‘How has this been done, monsieur?’ said [NAME]  “‘A crazed young common dog!
TTC	He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.
TTC	That was well done;” they had left the spot; “it shall not be in vain.
TTC	He spoke of him, in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself.
TTC	“[NAME],” said the spy.
TTC	“You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated; “don’t tremble so.
TTC	Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.
TTC	The [NAME] of the [NAME]  “I, [NAME] [NAME], unfortunate physician, native of [NAME], and afterwards resident in [NAME], write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the [NAME], during the last month of the year, 1767.
TTC	Almost a night, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], “to bring the dead out of their graves.”
TTC	“Good day, [NAME].”
TTC	Before our people’s time here, [NAME].
TTC	No, gentlemen; he’ll always show ’em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”
TTC	“Would he,” asked [NAME] [NAME], “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him?”
TTC	Not five or six?
TTC	As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too.
TTC	The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward.
TTC	“It would seem like flight, my darling.
TTC	To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell me,” said [NAME] [NAME], softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid of the whole subject.”
TTC	[NAME] and [NAME], stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres of land--a whole province of [NAME]--all [NAME] itself--lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line.
TTC	And what is the message to the unfortunate [NAME] in prison?”
TTC	It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved.
TTC	The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again.
TTC	“Your papers, travellers!”
TTC	I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid.”
TTC	There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else.
TTC	If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
TTC	Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners.
TTC	“What do you mean?
TTC	As The [NAME] descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads.
TTC	A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.
TTC	How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the [NAME] [NAME] of this country were full.
TTC	The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], look again upon the prisoner.
TTC	If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains.
TTC	The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.
TTC	[NAME], every one!”
TTC	“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the [NAME], and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”
TTC	A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward.
TTC	“It is the law.”
TTC	When they were alone, [NAME] [NAME] asked him what he had done?
TTC	“To whom do I address it?”
TTC	I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn.
TTC	Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” the [NAME] answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, “my hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.”
TTC	The [NAME] asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?
TTC	But you must be fatigued.
TTC	Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling!
TTC	The old man uttered an irrepressible cry.
TTC	Then she raised her voice and called out, “[NAME] [NAME]!
TTC	“You weren’t.
TTC	At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, [NAME].
TTC	It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out.
TTC	[NAME] never had a case in hand, anywhere, but [NAME] was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same [NAME], and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and [NAME] was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat.
TTC	He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when [NAME] [NAME], touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question:  “I say!
TTC	Such a present of plate as you have made ’em, is enough to bring tears into anybody’s eyes.
TTC	I believe,” said [NAME] [NAME], rather halting in his reassuring words, as the [NAME] manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, “I state the case, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	“I must see [NAME],” the [NAME] repeated, turning her another way.
TTC	As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile.
TTC	The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too.
TTC	And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
TTC	Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”
TTC	Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing.
TTC	Come on, and have it out in plain words!
TTC	That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the [NAME]), which led to a few words of secret conference.
TTC	“She lingered for a week.
TTC	Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the [NAME] was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of [NAME].
TTC	[NAME], we are pressed.”
TTC	“They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”
TTC	“Speak well of the law.
TTC	In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep, might have been easily found.
TTC	“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the honour of giving you welcome to [NAME] [NAME], and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us.
TTC	He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud: “‘Wait at [NAME] for [NAME].’
TTC	You must comply with it--take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] then, following his leader’s lead, examined the patriot: [NAME] [NAME], gentleman, by name.
TTC	The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves.
TTC	“How do I know!”
TTC	“We have seen nothing else,” returned The [NAME].
TTC	Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words.
TTC	“Not very much.
TTC	The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the [NAME] mail?”
TTC	He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME]’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning [NAME] [NAME]’s imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the [NAME]; and tried them on [NAME] [NAME], and had broken down with them signally.
TTC	“I little thought,” said [NAME] [NAME], “that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.”
TTC	But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me.
TTC	“But, do not believe,” said [NAME], upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say.
TTC	“If it was a light answer,” returned [NAME], “I beg your forgiveness for it.
TTC	Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew.
TTC	I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”
TTC	[NAME], my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say.
TTC	“Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” answered madame.
TTC	It had begun on [NAME], and here was [NAME] come.
TTC	Let it be.”
TTC	Surely, ghosts all.
TTC	With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment.
TTC	“Do you seek any guidance from me?”
TTC	“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of [NAME]’s yet!
TTC	Yet, this [NAME] [NAME] took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when [NAME] [NAME]’s head dropped upon her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: “[NAME]! look to that young lady.
TTC	I have been a [NAME] prisoner.
TTC	He wishes to have a messenger at hand.
TTC	It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life--and perhaps her child’s--and perhaps her father’s--for both have been seen with her at that place.
TTC	“Do you ask me for my advice, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.
TTC	“I do so, father, and I send him my [NAME] with it!”
TTC	One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday.
TTC	“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to work.
TTC	“Come on at a footpace!
TTC	This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when [NAME] [NAME] put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.
TTC	After all, the question is still where?”
