SH	“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out.
SH	“Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.
SH	He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
SH	“But it might have been a cry of surprise.
SH	“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”
SH	We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into [NAME] [NAME].
SH	‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’
SH	“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said [NAME], winking at me.
SH	“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all.
SH	A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
SH	“I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
SH	I should not wish a smarter assistant, [NAME] [NAME]; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.
SH	By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile [NAME], as to the personality of the criminal.”
SH	“An enemy?”  “Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.
SH	Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side.
SH	There are only two, a man and his wife.
SH	“I will try.
SH	But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me.
SH	“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the [NAME], so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare [NAME] the shock.
SH	“That also I could fathom.”
SH	“It is wonderful!”
SH	But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed.
SH	Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the  dog-cart at [NAME].
SH	It may be so in this case, also.”
SH	‘Is he not a beauty?’
SH	Two days later—that is, on [NAME] last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at [NAME] [NAME]’s place, near [NAME].
SH	I wasn’t best pleased, [NAME] [NAME], when she married again so soon after [NAME]’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself.
SH	If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind.
SH	But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”
SH	What [NAME] want to frighten a chap for?”
SH	There was no maker’s name; but, as [NAME] had remarked, the initials “[NAME] [NAME]” were scrawled upon one side.
SH	It arrived upon [NAME] morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of [NAME]’s fire.
SH	Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”
SH	At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
SH	“I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”
SH	Did I buy the geese off you?”
SH	But to-day being [NAME] rather complicates matters.
SH	She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball.
SH	“Nor from below,” said [NAME] [NAME], striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.
SH	“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.
SH	We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither [NAME] [NAME] nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.
SH	[NAME] laughed indulgently.
SH	“You can understand,” said [NAME] suavely, “that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”
SH	How long they seemed, those quarters!
SH	“[NAME], no, the mystery!” I cried.
SH	You are in my power.
SH	When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”
SH	“[NAME] help us!” said [NAME] after a long silence.
SH	“Yes?”  “The _[NAME] [NAME]_ had arrived here last week.
SH	It was headed, “[NAME], 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:
SH	[NAME] moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book.
SH	Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.
SH	he gasped.
SH	“But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.”
SH	“I find it hard enough to tackle facts, [NAME], without flying away after theories and fancies.”
SH	“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?”
SH	Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?”
SH	She came to [NAME] [NAME]’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
SH	“To an end?”  “Yes, sir.
SH	“‘I beg that you will state your business, [NAME],’ said I; ‘my time is of value.’
SH	How was it done?”
SH	He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies.
SH	Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress?
SH	“We are close there now,” my friend remarked.
SH	I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards.
SH	And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.
SH	I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar.
SH	“You have compromised yourself seriously.”
SH	“And I say east,” said my patient.
SH	“If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.
SH	Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.
SH	I shall want your help to-night.”
SH	With an  apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when [NAME] pulled  me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
SH	The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
SH	It cuts into glass as though it were putty.”
SH	“Pray continue your narrative.”
SH	“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter.
SH	But come in.
SH	It must be bought.”
SH	“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears.
SH	This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”  “About a month then.”
SH	“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track.
SH	I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas!
SH	“She walked into the breakfast-room.”
SH	“He investigated the case with great care, for [NAME] [NAME]’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death.
SH	The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object.
SH	He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us.
SH	[NAME] sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.
SH	She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.
SH	He had remained with [NAME] some little time, but had finally been called away.
SH	“And from a noble client?”  “One of the highest in [NAME].”
SH	Sit down and let us talk it over.”
SH	“I am to be neutral?”
SH	“‘Yes, [NAME].’  “‘And what salary do you ask?’
SH	I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property.
SH	“You did, [NAME], but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.
SH	“I have had diabetes for years.
SH	“This is a map of the [NAME] of [NAME],” he said.
SH	“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, [NAME] [NAME], for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.
SH	“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle [NAME] and my father [NAME].
SH	“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
SH	“The first was from [NAME], the second from [NAME], and the third from [NAME].”
SH	Here’s half a crown.
SH	On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool.
SH	“Oh, yes, [NAME]; I have only just left him.”
SH	I’ll swear it on a [NAME].
SH	“Are you, indeed, now?” cried [NAME] with some bitterness.
SH	Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places.
SH	“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”
SH	“I did not know.
SH	“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?”
SH	she cried, “he has followed me, then.”
SH	“That’s it!”
SH	“The [NAME]: I am afraid that I must press it.
SH	Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”
SH	There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches.
SH	“Yes, sir.”
SH	I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned [NAME] in his [NAME] [NAME] rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us.
SH	I don’t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice.
SH	But between ourselves, [NAME], it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me.
SH	His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.
SH	It is well thought of!”
SH	“But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”
SH	As to [NAME], I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.
SH	There’s never very much to do of a morning.”
SH	An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.
SH	“They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently.
SH	“It is a swamp adder!”
SH	But how to get to him in safety?
SH	Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.
SH	We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds.
SH	I think, [NAME], that if we drive to [NAME] [NAME] we shall just be in time for breakfast.”
SH	Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.
SH	She had a considerable sum of money—not less than [NAME] 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to [NAME] [NAME] entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.
SH	Stay where you are.
SH	So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery.
SH	“What do you imagine that it means?”
SH	His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there.
SH	“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	And, first, one or two questions, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with [NAME] in [NAME] [NAME], that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.
SH	“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.”
SH	“We could see the other side of the road and the [NAME].”
SH	“How on earth—”  “My dear fellow, I know you well.
SH	Give him an arm back into his chair, [NAME].
SH	“But it has twice been burgled.”
SH	“That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.
SH	Kill it and take it with you.’
SH	“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!
SH	I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man.
SH	“I tell you that it is [NAME], man.
SH	“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go.
SH	“On the contrary, [NAME], you can see everything.
SH	Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate.
SH	“What can you not understand?”
SH	I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes.
SH	[NAME] suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result.
SH	He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.
SH	It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
SH	Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in [NAME] [NAME] a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat.
SH	[NAME] shrugged his shoulders.
SH	It is evidently trying to your nerves.”
SH	“That was it, sir.”
SH	Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.
SH	It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives.
SH	They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.
SH	Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”
SH	I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.
SH	[NAME] [NAME], whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the [NAME] [NAME] festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.
SH	“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
SH	“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn.
SH	Each daughter can claim an income of [NAME] 250, in case of marriage.
SH	What a shrimp it is, to be sure!”
SH	But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.”
SH	“Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves.
SH	I took the paper from him and read as follows:  “TO THE [NAME]-[NAME] LEAGUE:
SH	“But it is impossible,” said [NAME] [NAME]; “the ladder was not there when the [NAME] went away.”
SH	It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.
SH	He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets.
SH	Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible.
SH	Nothing to complain of.
SH	And you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”  “None.
SH	“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of [NAME].
SH	His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] alone could have equalled.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	They had driven him home a dozen times from [NAME]-mews, and knew all about him.
SH	“How could they have decoyed him down there?
SH	“His conduct was certainly not very gracious.”
SH	Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.
SH	You will find me at the [NAME] under the name of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.
SH	Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”
SH	When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near [NAME] [NAME] once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
SH	His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him.
SH	Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down.
SH	I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to [NAME].
SH	This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it.
SH	I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police.
SH	In a hundred other ways he has helped him.
SH	It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
SH	‘Here are the very letters.
SH	“That is it on the dressing-table.”
SH	“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over [NAME]’s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at [NAME] in [NAME] and [NAME] in ’83.
SH	If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?”  “Precisely.
SH	“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of [NAME]’s.
SH	Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
SH	My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.
SH	“But you were on a friendly footing?”
SH	“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’
SH	“I cannot imagine.
SH	I would send you a wire.
SH	Still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
SH	“I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he.
SH	It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.”
SH	“In [NAME]’s name, what for?”
SH	Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.
SH	She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.
SH	The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the [NAME] of [NAME], the singular experience of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law.
SH	“So much for the Lascar manager.
SH	I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street.
SH	“He said that you could solve anything.”
SH	It must be in her own house.”
SH	“And how did he make his money?”
SH	I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me.
SH	“‘If you please, [NAME] [NAME].’  “‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply.
SH	It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.
SH	We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to [NAME].
SH	“You see it, [NAME]?” he yelled.
SH	You quite follow me?”  “Entirely.”
SH	There was the end of this tangled clue.
SH	I was keenly on my guard against him.
SH	I have known something of him before.”
SH	About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Terrible!
SH	I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”
SH	“I have a cab outside.”
SH	There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us.
SH	The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used.
SH	“I would give my fortune to have them back.”
SH	Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on [NAME], he was on [NAME] brought before the magistrates at [NAME], who have referred the case to the next Assizes.
SH	“That is not always so easy.”
SH	If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at [NAME].
SH	My wife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at [NAME] [NAME].
SH	We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the [NAME] [NAME], having put up our trap at a wayside public-house.
SH	“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’
SH	These pretended journeys to [NAME] were rather cumbrous.
SH	There he is, all safe and sound.
SH	With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.
SH	“[NAME],” said he.
SH	There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
SH	Then he sealed it and addressed it to “[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] _
SH	“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my companion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.”
SH	“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he.
SH	“‘The sundial in the garden.
SH	It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.
SH	Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man.
SH	I am a widower and have an only son, [NAME].
SH	voice—“have you never heard of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”
SH	I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.”
SH	Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the [NAME] [NAME], of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque _
SH	As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,  especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our  short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this  point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you  for the loss.
SH	“When my father took over the [NAME] property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up.
SH	You have come in by train this morning, I see.”
SH	He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.
SH	It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”
SH	It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon.
SH	That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise.
SH	It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry.
SH	There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”
SH	What can this be?’
SH	There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
SH	You are not averse to this trip, [NAME]?”
SH	“Her father is very rich?”
SH	“‘What, the red-headed man?’  “‘Yes.’
SH	But how—”  “Was there a secret marriage?”
SH	“A pair, by the sound,” said he.
SH	The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to [NAME], where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.
SH	By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.
SH	“I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”
SH	“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.
SH	Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at [NAME] 1000 apiece.
SH	“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.”
SH	[NAME] chuckled heartily.
SH	Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?”
SH	“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”
SH	She was a nonentity.
SH	A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.
SH	Will you not wait and breakfast?”
SH	“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met.
SH	[NAME] unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance.
SH	There is [NAME]’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the [NAME] branch of the [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME], the [NAME] [NAME], and [NAME]’s carriage-building depot.
SH	The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord.
SH	She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal.
SH	“Oh, if you say so, [NAME] [NAME], it is all right,” said the stranger with deference.
SH	Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad.
SH	“Look there!” said he.
SH	“I have come for advice.”
SH	As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door.
SH	The summons was a brief and urgent one.
SH	You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.
SH	“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a woman.”
SH	Pray proceed with your statement.”
SH	“There are none.”
SH	We shall soon see how he managed it.”
SH	[NAME] drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts.
SH	The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the [NAME] of [NAME].
SH	“Not at all.
SH	All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.
SH	Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.
SH	Both he and the [NAME] stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon.
SH	But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter.
SH	“What do you make of that?” asked [NAME].
SH	His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked.
SH	Do you see?’
SH	She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.
SH	I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man.
SH	‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’
SH	“I think, [NAME] [NAME], that we had better go in without you.
SH	Known to have been employed in an office in [NAME] [NAME].
SH	A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained.
SH	“Look here, [NAME],” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little.
SH	“But the mystery?”
SH	“I shall try not to miss anything of importance.
SH	“At eight in the morning.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this.
SH	I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.
SH	“Were they all fastened this morning?”
SH	Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”
SH	There will probably be some small unpleasantness.
SH	“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at [NAME], and all went as well as possible with us until the [NAME] of ’85.
SH	But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”
SH	“Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”
SH	“He is asleep,” said he.
SH	“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’
SH	His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to [NAME] and [NAME].
SH	“At half wages, in fact.”  “Yes.”
SH	“I thought people would talk if I went to the [NAME].”
SH	“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said [NAME] as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out.
SH	To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great [NAME] of [NAME], hereditary kings of [NAME].”
SH	“That is well.
SH	That, however, was out of the question.
SH	Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”
SH	You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.”
SH	“Well then,” said he, “my real name is [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said [NAME].
SH	“I wish you were all at the devil together.
SH	She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”
SH	In this I was asked to sit, and then [NAME] [NAME], walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to.
SH	“An elderly man, I presume?” said [NAME].
SH	I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
SH	“Good-morning, madam,” said [NAME] cheerily.
SH	“That is excellent.
SH	It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them.
SH	This gentleman, [NAME] [NAME], has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”
SH	“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked [NAME] as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
SH	There it is, where the lady is walking.”
SH	“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”
SH	It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.
SH	Kindly tell us now all about your connection with [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	Then [NAME] [NAME] began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced.
SH	“What on earth does this mean?”
SH	I asked with interest.
SH	“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house.
SH	And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character.
SH	Good-bye, and [NAME] help you in your undertaking.”
SH	“One other question,” said he.
SH	“[NAME], then.”
SH	The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear.
SH	This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.
SH	“I’ll do better.
SH	The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side.
SH	There was a long silence, during which [NAME] leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
SH	“And I feel dissatisfied.
SH	He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion.
SH	[NAME] chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits.
SH	[NAME] stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
SH	As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
SH	There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”
SH	“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said [NAME] gently.
SH	His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.
SH	“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”
SH	Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
SH	It seems to me, [NAME], that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you.
SH	The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.
SH	As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend [NAME] [NAME] had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.
SH	No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.”
SH	It would break their hearts.
SH	[NAME] nodded his head.
SH	“The ideal reasoner,” he remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it.
SH	“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair.
SH	“It is due at [NAME] at 11:30.”
SH	My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.
SH	To me it has been exceptionally so.
SH	“They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”
SH	There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
SH	A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
SH	“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
SH	Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt.
SH	That is The [NAME], and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”
SH	“That note only reached her yesterday,” said [NAME].
SH	This is my friend and colleague, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it.
SH	“‘Where have you put it?’ asked [NAME].
SH	“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to [NAME] [NAME], and a gentleman sprang out.
SH	Does it not strike you as a little singular that this [NAME], who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to [NAME], should still talk of marrying his son to [NAME]’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow?
SH	That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”
SH	So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it.
SH	The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
SH	Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it.
SH	When you drove home after the concert I called upon [NAME] [NAME] and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
SH	“No sign of it?”
SH	“My name is [NAME] [NAME],” he answered with a sidelong glance.
SH	“It is very kind of you.”
SH	His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top.
SH	[NAME] said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
SH	“But a very serious one to me,” returned the [NAME] reproachfully.
SH	He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
SH	Have your pistol ready in case we should need it.
SH	Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”
SH	The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed.
SH	For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.
SH	Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little [NAME] village.
SH	I had the hint from [NAME] that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game.
SH	This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.
SH	If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you.
SH	Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”
SH	The [NAME] will be gone by that time, and [NAME] will, we hope, be incapable.
SH	“So they have.
SH	The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath.
SH	“Whose house is it?”  “[NAME] [NAME]’s.”
SH	“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”
SH	Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?”
SH	“The [NAME]: What did you understand by that?
SH	“A diamond, sir?
SH	You see, [NAME], our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.
SH	“[NAME] is his name.”
SH	“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME].
SH	I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’
SH	Why should I attempt to conceal it?”
SH	“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
SH	“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’
SH	Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.
SH	You see that we have been as good as our word.”
SH	she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
SH	I have some account of the matter here, I believe.”
SH	His face flushed and darkened.
SH	Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.”
SH	Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others.
SH	I marked the spot upon my own head.
SH	But there is a ring at the bell, [NAME], and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client.
SH	“‘Dear me!’
SH	“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”
SH	As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors.
SH	‘From [NAME]!’ said he as he took it up, ‘[NAME] postmark!
SH	“Who was the criminal, then?”
SH	then?”  “Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son.
SH	But the writing?”
SH	The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly.
SH	Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.”
SH	“This is my friend, [NAME] [NAME], before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.
SH	“Before the what?” asked [NAME] with a start.
SH	“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates.
SH	During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.
SH	So long, then!”
SH	‘You have doubtless heard of the [NAME] [NAME]?’
SH	I hardly noticed his appearance.
SH	“‘Never mind.
SH	We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum.
SH	That is important.
SH	I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself.
SH	“Still, if I had married [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], of course I’d have done my duty by him.
SH	Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.
SH	For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”
SH	One by one the management of the noble houses of [NAME] [NAME] is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the [NAME].
SH	Oh, [NAME] [NAME], I wish you would do as much for me.
SH	Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”
SH	My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.
SH	“And she would need to be,” said [NAME] gravely.
SH	Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape.
SH	What a queen she would have made!”
SH	And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”
SH	He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it.
SH	I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still.
SH	“‘I have already given you my word.’
SH	But I would rather not talk about the creature, [NAME] [NAME], and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”
SH	“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.
SH	“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he.
SH	They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of [NAME]’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.
SH	Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, [NAME] desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”
SH	To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the [NAME] [NAME] air of the vault.
SH	A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl.
SH	[NAME] thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
SH	Why, bless my soul!
SH	“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”
SH	“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
SH	For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”
SH	They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.”
SH	No one but [NAME] [NAME] was in favour of it.”
SH	He slapped it down upon the table in front of him.
SH	She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.
SH	Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”
SH	Suppose that this man [NAME] had thrust [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
SH	You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from [NAME].
SH	“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?”
SH	I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column.
SH	“You are sure of it!
SH	A CASE OF [NAME]  “My dear fellow,” said [NAME] [NAME] as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at [NAME] [NAME], “life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.
SH	I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.’
SH	The goose, sir!”
SH	She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”
SH	It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise.
SH	But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice.
SH	“Yes, but only for you and me.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.
SH	The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
SH	It is in the personal column of the _[NAME] [NAME]_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], second son of the [NAME] of [NAME], and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the only daughter of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner.
SH	It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
SH	I know that he is right.
SH	Kindly hand me down the letter [NAME] of the _[NAME] [NAME]_ which stands upon the shelf beside you.
SH	As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
SH	The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.
SH	“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”
SH	I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to [NAME] [NAME]’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance.
SH	[NAME] refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which [NAME] [NAME] was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.
SH	“I shall be delighted.”
SH	The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”
SH	From north, south, [NAME], and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
SH	I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”
SH	“Well, it is conjectured to be so.
SH	My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened.
SH	“I assure you that I am in your hands.”
SH	Of course, that is only just for the time.
SH	“Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara.
SH	“And help.”
SH	He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart.
SH	At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.
SH	It is not a common experience among employers in this age.
SH	There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.
SH	It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder.
SH	He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.
SH	“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”
SH	I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
SH	I slept at [NAME] [NAME] that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the [NAME] of [NAME] rushed into the room.
SH	“One horse?” interjected [NAME].
SH	Your affection for [NAME] blinds you as to the awful consequences to me.
SH	His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of [NAME] 2nd.”
SH	And when he speaks of [NAME] [NAME], or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of _the_ woman.  [NAME].
SH	“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.
SH	The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.
SH	“Did your wife hear all this?”
SH	[NAME] grinned at the last item.
SH	“No, I am descending.”
SH	“I think that I heard a ring,” said [NAME].
SH	But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.
SH	I shall be true to [NAME].
SH	“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’
SH	It must, then, be something out of the house.
SH	“What did you go into the pool for?”
SH	“I would pay ten.”
SH	“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair.
SH	It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this [NAME] who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.
SH	I could see that [NAME] was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client.
SH	Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.”
SH	“But we can’t all be.”
SH	For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”
SH	The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come.
SH	“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.
SH	“Nothing could have been better.
SH	“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process.
SH	“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said [NAME], taking the paper and glancing his eye down it.
SH	I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”
SH	“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?”
SH	“‘Where could I find him?’
SH	he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed!
SH	Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later.
SH	I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.
SH	“I cannot say that I have.”
SH	So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.
SH	From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us.
SH	It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession.
SH	I am going out now!”
SH	It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it.
SH	“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said [NAME], unlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more.
SH	And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”
SH	“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”
SH	He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:  “[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“It is the purest accident.
SH	“Then I will.”
SH	I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face.
SH	By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.
SH	“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred.
SH	It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:  “[NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop.
SH	I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields.
SH	“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’
SH	“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”
SH	It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Then the page we have seen—”  “Is such as we might expect.
SH	A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled [NAME]’ surmise as to his habits.
SH	It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties.
SH	Now, if you cared to apply, [NAME] [NAME], you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’
SH	Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.
SH	Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done.
SH	I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office.
SH	Of course there is only one feasible explanation.
SH	“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel.
SH	The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below.
SH	A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
SH	“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
SH	“My uncle [NAME] emigrated to [NAME] when he was a young man and became a planter in [NAME], where he was reported to have done very well.
SH	“I have hopes.”
SH	“I advertised for him in last [NAME]’s _Chronicle_,” said she.
SH	“The lady could not move her bed.
SH	It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.
SH	I smiled and shook my head.
SH	“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.”
SH	In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that [NAME] [NAME] had some very strong reason for leaving [NAME].
SH	I heard that, and I came down.”
SH	He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
SH	“Read it aloud.”
SH	“Pray do so.”
SH	It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of [NAME].
SH	Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”
SH	The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited.
SH	I have been out to [NAME] since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.
SH	I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
SH	“Now for [NAME] [NAME],” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air.
SH	That is what makes me uneasy.
SH	He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.
SH	“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’
SH	“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
SH	“I am sure.”
SH	“That is possible.”
SH	“I am [NAME] [NAME],” answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
SH	Well, here’s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house.
SH	When the commissionaire had gone, [NAME] took up the stone and held it against the light.
SH	We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”
SH	There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall.
SH	On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.
SH	“When [NAME] had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.
SH	“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”
SH	“The fire looks very seasonable in this weather.
SH	This is very interesting.
SH	He never did wish us to go anywhere.
SH	Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”
SH	“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone.
SH	I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of [NAME] could earn £ 700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the [NAME].
SH	“I should not dream of trying,” said he.
SH	I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
SH	“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, [NAME] [NAME],” said he.
SH	Let the matter drop and say no more.
SH	I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
SH	Who would have ever believed it?’
SH	I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result.
SH	There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor.
SH	“What’s up, then?” asked [NAME] with a twinkle in his eye.
SH	“I pray not, sir.
SH	He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in [NAME] [NAME], where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town.
SH	‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me.
SH	I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.”
SH	“Have you the chisel and the bags?
SH	Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
SH	And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”
SH	“From his hat?”  “Precisely.”
SH	“Yes, sir.”
SH	“You think so, too?”
SH	What could it be?
SH	I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and [NAME] was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to [NAME], perhaps, to show him that I was alive.
SH	[NAME] turned to the page indicated.
SH	I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”
SH	“He’s gone for the dog!”
SH	[NAME] twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man’s excited face.
SH	As to [NAME] [NAME], she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.”
SH	“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said [NAME] quietly.
SH	I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
SH	I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
SH	I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more.
SH	You heard him yourselves to-night.
SH	“They are typewritten,” I remarked.
SH	“‘Yes, [NAME].’  “‘As governess?’
SH	That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days.
SH	Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details.
SH	“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to [NAME], I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt.
SH	“There you are,” said he.
SH	The [NAME] was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime.
SH	He has not been home for two days.
SH	Its disappearance, however, was but momentary.
SH	However, I was in time for the last train to [NAME], and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock.
SH	“And the lady, I fancy, is [NAME] [NAME],” observed [NAME], shading his eyes.
SH	She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field.
SH	Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know.
SH	I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber after all.
SH	“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”
SH	He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money.
SH	Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
SH	[NAME] was a plumber in the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with [NAME] [NAME], the foreman; but when [NAME] [NAME] came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
SH	“Yes, there are steps on the landing.
SH	We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’
SH	“Not the [NAME] of [NAME]’s blue carbuncle!”
SH	There is as much sense in [NAME] as in [NAME], and as much knowledge of the world.”  [NAME].
SH	“[NAME], no, nothing of the kind.
SH	“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution.
SH	“Oh, dear!
SH	“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.”
SH	I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
SH	“The [NAME]: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from [NAME]?
SH	Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane.
SH	“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”
SH	“Pray take this chair by the fire, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.
SH	What are you going to do yourself?”
SH	He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
SH	“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on.
SH	I leave a photograph which he might care to  possess; and I remain, dear [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],  “Very truly yours,  “IRENE [NAME], _[NAME]_ [NAME].”  “What a woman—oh, what a woman!”
SH	The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side.
SH	You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’
SH	“A [NAME]: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
SH	“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Every clue seems to slip through my fingers.
SH	So much for the police-court,” said [NAME] thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper.
SH	It is true that ‘For [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘[NAME] [NAME]’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of [NAME], and some hundreds of [NAME] [NAME] in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”
SH	And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”
SH	“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.
SH	Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.
SH	I am at my wit’s end.
SH	They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the [NAME] were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood.
SH	As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney.
SH	“Yes, sir.
SH	I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me.
SH	he asked with his eyes open.
SH	I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’
SH	“Who is on duty?” asked [NAME].
SH	There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de [NAME] [NAME]_ pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles.
SH	You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important.
SH	His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life.
SH	He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table.
SH	“Their reasons for their conduct.
SH	“Then I can wait in the next room.”
SH	What a week she must have spent!”
SH	My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you.
SH	I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the [NAME] [NAME], with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side.
SH	I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at [NAME] [NAME] to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze.
SH	“[NAME], his friend.
SH	I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’
SH	I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”
SH	You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.
SH	With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.
SH	We must have a look at it.”
SH	They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.
SH	“And how did you find out?”
SH	Light a cigar and let me expound.”
SH	“This is the [NAME] separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it.
SH	“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl.
SH	“No, it is not even attached to a wire.
SH	“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”
SH	“I am sure we owe you an apology, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us.
SH	This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”
SH	“No, she was in her night-dress.
SH	As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”
SH	She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me.
SH	Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction.
SH	A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.
SH	“Extremely so.
SH	We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
SH	“You have a maid who has a sweetheart?
SH	He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas.
SH	There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
SH	We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.
SH	Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.
SH	Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
SH	He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:  “Good-night, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“As a rule,” said [NAME], “the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.
SH	“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’
SH	Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete.
SH	It is a pure matter of form.
SH	“Yes, but very small ones.
SH	“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked.
SH	“This gentleman?”
SH	“‘Yes, I promise.’
SH	[NAME]-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”
SH	“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he.
SH	Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time.
SH	He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.
SH	That is his main fault, but on the whole he’s a good worker.
SH	At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME], who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
SH	Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from [NAME] to inquire more deeply into it.”
SH	“He is said to be the richest man on the [NAME] slope.”
SH	I took advantage now of my attainments.
SH	There is something distinctly novel about some of the features.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.
SH	He shall find me ready when he comes back.”
SH	“Well, when they closed their [NAME] offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel.
SH	Come this way.
SH	Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’
SH	Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”
SH	“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my [NAME].
SH	Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.
SH	“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning.
SH	A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.
SH	But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right.
SH	The door of [NAME] [NAME] was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.
SH	“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was.
SH	“[NAME], no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”
SH	“Where is it, then?”  “[NAME] [NAME], in [NAME].
SH	It was to be at [NAME] [NAME]’s, near [NAME]’s [NAME], and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it.
SH	I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material.
SH	He gives me hopes.”
SH	“[NAME]!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties.
SH	Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to [NAME].
SH	“I don’t say that.
SH	He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
SH	I am lost without my [NAME].
SH	The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples.
SH	We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.
SH	it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.
SH	“Where, indeed?”
SH	We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.
SH	My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the [NAME] robbery at the hotel.
SH	He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
SH	Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”
SH	There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is [NAME] [NAME] a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?”
SH	It grew worse as [NAME] grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police.
SH	I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.
SH	It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in [NAME].”
SH	“On the contrary,” said [NAME], “it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds.
SH	He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards.
SH	Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
SH	The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning.
SH	You are probably aware that [NAME]-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in [NAME]?’
SH	It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.
SH	“Entirely.”  “Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present.
SH	“I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your [NAME]’s business to a more successful conclusion.”
SH	Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open.
SH	I think that I recognise the symptoms.
SH	She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter.
SH	Because he limped—he was lame.”
SH	“I can’t imagine.
SH	We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
SH	Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.
SH	It is there that I shall seek it.”
SH	Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.
SH	My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“The family was at one time among the richest in [NAME], and the estates extended over the borders into [NAME] in the north, and [NAME] in the west.
SH	“If you remember, [NAME] was an exceedingly hot day, and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.
SH	“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”
SH	It is my belief, [NAME], founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in [NAME] do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”
SH	Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;  and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless  labour and an ill-service to me.
SH	Do you feel equal to it?”
SH	I trust, [NAME], that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin [NAME] is innocent of this crime.”
SH	“Pray take a seat.”
SH	“Oscillation upon the pavement always means an _affaire de [NAME]_.
SH	“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said [NAME] carelessly.
SH	“He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in [NAME], and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] were married, by special license, in [NAME] the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of [NAME].
SH	Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.
SH	[NAME], he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:  “‘I wish to the [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], that I was a red-headed man.’
SH	What is it?”
SH	“And brought [NAME] [NAME] down from [NAME] in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	You won’t shake hands before I go?”
SH	If she had, it must be someone from [NAME] because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely.
SH	The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
SH	It is nearly five now.
SH	The name is no doubt familiar to you.”
SH	I braved him to do his worst.
SH	To [NAME], as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass.
SH	I went and saw him.
SH	“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back.
SH	Still, it might be worth while to call [NAME]’ attention to it.
SH	“Then I fail to follow your [NAME].
SH	“What do you mean?”
SH	From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.
SH	“What of the rat, then?”
SH	I took a step forward.
SH	It may, however, have been written on [NAME] and only posted to-day.”
SH	Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady.
SH	“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you.
SH	“I was mad—insane.”
SH	Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.
SH	I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired.
SH	“Do you know, [NAME],” said [NAME] as we sat together in the gathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night.
SH	I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.
SH	He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
SH	The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish.
SH	“[NAME]’s photograph!”
SH	My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the [NAME] [NAME] from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.
SH	We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard.
SH	There is one point which I should wish to determine.”
SH	One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.
SH	Take your pistol, and we will enter [NAME] [NAME]’s room.”
SH	Come at once.
SH	I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.”
SH	It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if [NAME] sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.
SH	I shall take your advice in every particular.”
SH	“The stable lane?”
SH	He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
SH	“[NAME] let us have it, for all that.”
SH	“Which surely he restored to their owner?”
SH	“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.
SH	“We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.
SH	“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours.
SH	“‘I should be happy to advance it without further [NAME] from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear.
SH	“I cannot tell.”
SH	“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and sharp instrument.”
SH	With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
SH	They are the [NAME]’s pet baits.
SH	I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was acquitted at the [NAME] on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by [NAME] and submitted to the defending counsel.
SH	“You villain!”
SH	“Why did you beat the pavement?”
SH	That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.”
SH	If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”
SH	“He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.
SH	“How many?
SH	“Yes, there was a ring.
SH	The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by [NAME] [NAME] as we travelled back next day.
SH	At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.
SH	“It was an hour’s good drive.”
SH	She is an American and came from [NAME] with her.”
SH	“[NAME], no,” cried [NAME], shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen.
SH	“The doctor?”
SH	“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
SH	“This went on day after day, [NAME] [NAME], and on [NAME] the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work.
SH	Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
SH	As to what you tell me of poor [NAME], it goes to my very heart.
SH	I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound.
SH	Shortly after our return to [NAME] my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near [NAME].
SH	I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the [NAME] as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.
SH	It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”
SH	“Who by?”  “The landlord of the [NAME].”
SH	“The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes.
SH	I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.
SH	I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable.
SH	“Ah, yes, of course!
SH	“Where did he live, then?”
SH	And now, [NAME] [NAME], we must leave you for if [NAME] [NAME] returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
SH	He is older than [NAME], a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty.
SH	“Where, then?”  “Her banker or her lawyer.
SH	“But how did you gain them?”
SH	“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week.
SH	At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to [NAME] upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with [NAME] [NAME], who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.
SH	Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?”
SH	“But he might be a bachelor.”
SH	“Yes, I have one waiting.”
SH	However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.
SH	I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
SH	We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”
SH	It is my business to know what other people don’t know.”
SH	“It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.
SH	“By [NAME], [NAME]!” said he, “this is treasure trove indeed.
SH	“Then, how do you know?”
SH	I had expected to see [NAME] [NAME] impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
SH	All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window.
SH	I knew the firm for which this man worked.
SH	“Undoubtedly.
SH	Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.
SH	He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.
SH	But what was she to do?
SH	Your wife has been waiting this two days for you.
SH	“It may be so, or it may not, [NAME] [NAME],” said he, “but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me.
SH	“And who could it be who was her confederate?
SH	You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.
SH	“Oh, so so.
SH	He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.
SH	‘You have destroyed it!
SH	This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate.
SH	The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes.
SH	“Certainly, sir,” said [NAME], who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm.
SH	“‘Quite so.
SH	They have now fled together.”
SH	It is a _[NAME]_ [NAME], with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories.
SH	He was too good and kind to leave me so.
SH	When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
SH	We are but preventing her from injuring another.
SH	Three gone before you could wink!’
SH	“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.”
SH	But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.
SH	Do you not see some loophole, some flaw?
SH	He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the [NAME], that whatever happened I would always be true to him.
SH	As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
SH	“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room.
SH	In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”  [NAME].
SH	You must not interfere, come what may.
SH	“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”
SH	But soon he found that that would not answer forever.
SH	There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.
SH	“Just look up the trains in [NAME],” said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.
SH	It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”
SH	They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.
SH	We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to.
SH	“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said [NAME].
SH	“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”
SH	“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
SH	They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back.
SH	I’ll take you round to him myself.”
SH	I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it.
SH	“I should be immensely obliged to you.”
SH	“Last [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks.
SH	The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.
SH	Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”
SH	All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
SH	“Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity.
SH	“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’
SH	“None of those which come to me are.
SH	There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him.
SH	“Oh, really!
SH	[NAME] shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
SH	“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given.
SH	“You have a grand gift of silence, [NAME],” said he.
SH	“It is really two days since you had the letter.
SH	“Dark enough and sinister enough.”
SH	Both these witnesses depose that [NAME] [NAME] was walking alone.
SH	I have myself some small business matters to attend to.
SH	“My messenger reached you, then?” asked [NAME].
SH	Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”
SH	You need not, however, go to  the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear  daughter [NAME] (now in [NAME]), which would, I should think,  fit you very well.
SH	A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into.
SH	The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.
SH	The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that [NAME] [NAME] was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.
SH	“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way.
SH	“Then, pray consult,” said [NAME], shutting his eyes once more.
SH	“Let me see,” said [NAME], standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.
SH	“How did you deduce the select?”
SH	“What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”
SH	And where was the place?
SH	[NAME] [NAME] leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
SH	In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from [NAME], there is nothing which presents any features of interest.
SH	Did you fasten all the windows?”
SH	“If so, much may have happened between.”
SH	“‘What are you doing there?’
SH	It’s a cold night,” said [NAME].
SH	Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”
SH	It was my coil of hair.
SH	I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature.
SH	The alarm of fire was admirably done.
SH	You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other.
SH	My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.
SH	If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.
SH	“Very good.
SH	You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”
SH	He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
SH	The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”
SH	‘[NAME] [NAME] and I will take you up to see the machine.’
SH	“What on earth has that to do with it?”
SH	“This is where we shall find them.”
SH	“Well, the snuff, then, and the [NAME]?”  “I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”
SH	You have not observed.
SH	It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity.
SH	“[NAME], no; it is, it is his very own writing!”
SH	“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me.
SH	You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in [NAME] in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The [NAME] last year.
SH	The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny.
SH	I believe that that is the village inn over there?”
SH	“You see, [NAME],” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in [NAME] [NAME], “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the [NAME], and the copying of the _[NAME]_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day.
SH	‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, [NAME], ladies’ fancies must be consulted.
SH	That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families.
SH	Never in my life have I seen such a sight.
SH	It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”
SH	‘And the pay?’  “‘Is £ 4 a week.’
SH	The same post brought me a letter from [NAME] & [NAME], of [NAME] [NAME], to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.
SH	“His name is [NAME] [NAME], and he’s not such a youth, either.
SH	“A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it.
SH	“‘And my duties, [NAME]?
SH	I must wire to the [NAME] without delay.”
SH	“What could she mean by that note, [NAME] [NAME]?
SH	Have you a cab?”
SH	“You have but to name it.”
SH	On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
SH	I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
SH	The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there.
SH	The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home.
SH	I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.
SH	Where were we going, and what were we to do?
SH	For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
SH	At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the [NAME], and she to her own house.
SH	“Six out and six back.
SH	“Have you her photograph?”  “I brought this with me.”
SH	I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months.
SH	“‘And a very good thing, too!’
SH	“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
SH	Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
SH	“The decline of his fortunes, then?”
SH	“Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”
SH	“I could hardly believe my ears.
SH	I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”
SH	I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do  not inconvenience you.
SH	“[NAME], perhaps, the [NAME] of Four.”
SH	What did you do, then?
SH	“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.
SH	A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you?
SH	“No, but the enclosure is.”
SH	It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose.
SH	I trust, [NAME] [NAME], that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”
SH	There must be some strong reason behind.”
SH	“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me.
SH	[NAME], [NAME], I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now.
SH	“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
SH	I have it here in my museum.”
SH	Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body.
SH	“No, I must go.
SH	“Get back into your chair!”
SH	All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.’
SH	Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?’
SH	The roughs had also fled at the appearance of [NAME], so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable [NAME] goose.”
SH	“‘Yes, it was gone.’
SH	“Not in a good cause.”
SH	“‘We have judged it best that you should come late.
SH	A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as [NAME] shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
SH	Now for the facts.
SH	“And how have you succeeded?”
SH	“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me.
SH	It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the [NAME], and so through [NAME] [NAME] to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.
SH	“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.
SH	The banker wrung his hands.
SH	He has seen too much.
SH	“Do you mean that she has left [NAME]?”
SH	“The [NAME]: That is for the court to decide.
SH	“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’
SH	Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room.
SH	He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted [NAME] street.
SH	You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them.
SH	There was no rain, as [NAME] had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless.
SH	Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”
SH	I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.
SH	For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”
SH	“‘Where are they all, [NAME]?’
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had her lunch, started for the [NAME], did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through [NAME] [NAME] on her way back to the station.
SH	Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”
SH	It would be a pity to miss it.”
SH	I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.
SH	“It came here.”
SH	“‘Certainly not.
SH	The [NAME] is not on the direct line to the station.
SH	“You think that he is dead?”
SH	“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place.
SH	“Not a word.
SH	This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of [NAME] [NAME]’s preserves.
SH	“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him.
SH	“The [NAME]: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
SH	I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you.
SH	Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of [NAME], but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even [NAME]’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
SH	“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up.
SH	‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’
SH	He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.
SH	When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul.
SH	“Very good.
SH	“Do you know the young lady?”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The [NAME]_ and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece.
SH	“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father.
SH	There is a woodcock, I believe.
SH	However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in [NAME], the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.
SH	You fail, however, to reason from what you see.
SH	“A house on fire?” asked [NAME] as the train steamed off again on its way.
SH	“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the [NAME] to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”
SH	[NAME] shook his head gravely.
SH	The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.
SH	I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is.
SH	But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law.
SH	“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at [NAME], [NAME] [NAME].’
SH	“I thought it as well,” said [NAME] as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.
SH	An examination showed that one of the [NAME]-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked.
SH	[NAME] cut the cord and removed the transverse bar.
SH	Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”
SH	He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent.
SH	When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear.
SH	“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said [NAME].
SH	Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in [NAME].
SH	As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue.
SH	She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding.
SH	“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on.
SH	From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’
SH	“This was quite too good to lose, [NAME].
SH	This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in [NAME].
SH	“You will excuse my beginning without you, [NAME],” said he, “but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”
SH	What a strange idea!”
SH	It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”
SH	“Will you come with me?” asked [NAME], glancing up.
SH	“I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again.
SH	“[NAME] dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.
SH	“We must have a cab.”
SH	I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work.
SH	“Certainly.”
SH	We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house.
SH	“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
SH	And now let us hear a true account of the next act.
SH	The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber.
SH	“You are not very vulnerable from above,” [NAME] remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
SH	He would see it through the ventilator.”
SH	“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure.
SH	It was a bright, crisp [NAME] morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun.
SH	“What are they?”
SH	“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes.
SH	Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”
SH	I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the [NAME].”
SH	When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since.
SH	I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough.
SH	“[NAME] plays at the [NAME] [NAME]’s [NAME] this afternoon,” he remarked.
SH	“Where does that bell communicate with?”
SH	“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications.
SH	[NAME] is rare.
SH	In that case, [NAME] [NAME], I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’
SH	Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon.
SH	I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man.
SH	As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.
SH	It is true that I had a country walk on [NAME] and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it.
SH	The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME] presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back.
SH	“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”
SH	There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’
SH	which was a usual signal between my father and myself.
SH	For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor.
SH	I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter.
SH	The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
SH	“Well, I guess you have every cause to be.”
SH	before seeing him.
SH	“Well?”  “That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy.
SH	Oh, he will be silent!’
SH	[NAME] had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least.
SH	“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet.
SH	“How is the glass?
SH	“That is better,” said [NAME] [NAME] serenely.
SH	I am sure, [NAME] [NAME], that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.
SH	“‘Tell me all about it,’ said [NAME]  “‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the [NAME] has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.
SH	“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”
SH	Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
SH	There was no sign of him there.
SH	You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”
SH	But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”
SH	“Then what are they?
SH	“Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!”
SH	Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama.
SH	One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another.
SH	“Yesterday.”
SH	“‘You blackguard!’
SH	It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.
SH	I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one.
SH	“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.”
SH	So say the [NAME]-mews, to a man.
SH	“I have seen those symptoms before,” said [NAME], throwing his cigarette into the fire.
SH	The banker recoiled in horror.
SH	Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”
SH	“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the [NAME] of [NAME], in [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the [NAME].”
SH	“The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.”
SH	That is important.”
SH	“Precisely.
SH	He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”
SH	“[NAME],” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.
SH	she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at [NAME].
SH	“They considered that it might be caused by [NAME]’s closing his bedroom door.”
SH	Gone was the coarse brown tint!
SH	Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was.
SH	That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
SH	In two hours we must be on the scene of action.
SH	You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described.
SH	You’ll know all about it presently.
SH	He swung himself up onto the roof.
SH	It was difficult to refuse any of [NAME] [NAME]’ requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery.
SH	And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together.
SH	We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the [NAME] of [NAME].
SH	“I am afraid, [NAME], that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences.
SH	She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin.
SH	It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.
SH	“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”  “‘[NAME] 22nd.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] turned white to the lips as she listened.
SH	All was going well when [NAME] laid his grip upon me.
SH	There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.”
SH	“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said [NAME] with a yawn.
SH	They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.
SH	That is how he did it.”
SH	‘For the love of [NAME]!’
SH	It is introspective, and I want to introspect.
SH	“‘Oh, at his new offices.
SH	It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex.
SH	In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room.
SH	Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.
SH	We have a seven-mile drive before us.”
SH	The building was of [NAME], [NAME]-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.
SH	“Oh, yes, I did.
SH	It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.
SH	“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his natural manner.
SH	I think that I will go in and have a word with [NAME], and perhaps write a little note.
SH	He was kind to her also in his [NAME], boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.
SH	Step into my room here.”
SH	“It is really very good of you to come, [NAME],” said he.
SH	“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with an oath.
SH	And now, [NAME], we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ [NAME], where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.”
SH	“Was your sister dressed?”
SH	I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”
SH	“[NAME], pooh!
SH	I must compliment you.”
SH	“When I arrived at the house,” continued [NAME], “I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me.
SH	It had escaped my memory.
SH	I hope that you have done what I asked you, [NAME]?”
SH	Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.
SH	Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions.
SH	“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.
SH	“‘Very likely.
SH	I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.
SH	“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £ 200?’
SH	The salesman chuckled grimly.
SH	[NAME] [NAME], however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face.
SH	“So I have heard.”
SH	I will tell you, however.
SH	I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”
SH	“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £ 50,000 at once.
SH	One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole.
SH	You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.
SH	In this way you see [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”
SH	“Then you won’t forgive me?
SH	“You had my note?”
SH	I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’
SH	On the [NAME] side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake.
SH	A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.
SH	This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.”
SH	And this promises to be interesting.
SH	I thought that he was delirious.
SH	Therefore he used a holder.
SH	“‘My accomplishments, [NAME], may be less than you imagine,’ said [NAME] ‘A little [NAME], a little German, music, and drawing—’  “‘[NAME], tut!’
SH	But that was not quite good enough, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	This fellow, a [NAME], was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
SH	It must be done at once.
SH	Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us.
SH	What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
SH	“Very glad to see you.
SH	“I shall go down to [NAME] quite easy in my mind now.
SH	“I am armed.”
SH	As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, [NAME] [NAME] came out to me, looking as merry and [NAME] as ever.
SH	His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
SH	I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else.
SH	“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms.
SH	“I have had nothing else to do.”
SH	“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.
SH	I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the [NAME] [NAME], which is opposite, and drove to [NAME], from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”
SH	“Yes, it would be as well.”
SH	And your address had been given me.
SH	“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once.
SH	Did she know where her husband was?
SH	“I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.”
SH	“That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.
SH	In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
SH	“But this maid, [NAME], as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”
SH	I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”
SH	“It may give him a sleepless night.
SH	He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
SH	“There are one or two very singular points about this room.
SH	“The young lady came to [NAME], then, and you renewed your acquaintance?”
SH	He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
SH	“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	she asked.
SH	“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”
SH	As I drove home to my house in [NAME] I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME], and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
SH	“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.”
SH	Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”
SH	“Then, as to money?”  “You have _[NAME] [NAME]_.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME], of [NAME] [NAME], is  acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no  objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it  might be of some assistance.
SH	So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
SH	“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing.
SH	It corresponds with the injuries.
SH	As you may observe, [NAME] [NAME], my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.
SH	There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the [NAME] high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door.
SH	He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
SH	Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind.
SH	“‘Thank [NAME],’ he cried.
SH	“Of course you are.
SH	“A confidential servant?”  “A little too much so.
SH	It was no wonder that no one was stirring.
SH	Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.
SH	I held the little printed slip to the light.
SH	They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.
SH	“Oh, you mean the little problem of the [NAME] [NAME] furniture van.
SH	Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be?
SH	I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.
SH	“May I see your father if I call to-morrow?”
SH	Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.
SH	“‘She came in just now by the back door.
SH	“It may not come to that,” said [NAME].
SH	As well as I could learn, [NAME] [NAME] had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in [NAME] [NAME]’s hands.
SH	“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] tried to get away, but [NAME] caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other.
SH	“And now it is time that we arranged our little plans.
SH	“I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime.
SH	“Thank you.
SH	How do you go back?”
SH	It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers.
SH	There could be no possible reason.
SH	Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate.
SH	“Thank you.
SH	There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.”
SH	Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
SH	Faces to the south, then, and quick march!”
SH	Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while [NAME] had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.
SH	That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”
SH	“To eat it!”
SH	“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.
SH	“You look dissatisfied.”
SH	“I am very much afraid that it is not.
SH	“Then what has happened to him?”
SH	“I am saved!
SH	“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was [NAME] [NAME].
SH	If she does not love your [NAME], there is no reason why she should interfere with your [NAME]’s plan.”
SH	I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket.
SH	They were all horrible to me.
SH	The distinction is clear.
SH	What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?”
SH	The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty.
SH	One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company.
SH	It was twenty-five minutes past four.
SH	cried [NAME]; “the deadliest snake in [NAME].
SH	[NAME], who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.”
SH	This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.
SH	“Quite so.
SH	“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me.
SH	The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it.
SH	On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the [NAME]-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand.
SH	“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.
SH	she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’
SH	“[NAME], that was not the point.
SH	“When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”
SH	“I have nothing to do to-day.
SH	“It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”
SH	I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.”
SH	“As to the letters,” he continued, glancing over them, “they are very commonplace.
SH	[NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity.
SH	On entering his room, I found [NAME] in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as [NAME] [NAME], the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
SH	From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
SH	“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling.
SH	I could manage it better if I were alone.
SH	A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious.
SH	I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”
SH	Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
SH	“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks.
SH	Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives.
SH	“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
SH	Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
SH	“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”
SH	“You had my note?”
SH	“I had hoped,” suggested [NAME], “that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.”
SH	“You horrify me.”
SH	“That is back through the house into [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME].
SH	From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”
SH	I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said [NAME]  “‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed.
SH	It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls.
SH	She knows that the [NAME] is capable of having her waylaid and searched.
SH	“And [NAME] [NAME]?”  “Threatens to send them the photograph.
SH	“Yes, sir, that be the house of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” remarked the driver.
SH	“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”
SH	“It is our task to find that out,” replied [NAME]; “so now, if you please, [NAME] [NAME], we will set off for [NAME] together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”
SH	A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-[NAME].
SH	I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
SH	He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.
SH	“Then dress.
SH	The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.
SH	“Oh, yes, easily.”
SH	“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder.
SH	“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar.
SH	I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
SH	“But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.”
SH	He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
SH	“I am glad to hear your [NAME] say so.”
SH	If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off.
SH	“She will not sell.”
SH	The matter is a perfectly trivial [NAME] jerked his thumb in the direction of the old [NAME] there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”
SH	“I do not quite follow,” he said.
SH	One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the [NAME] tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from [NAME] and were waiting in the consulting-room.
SH	She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
SH	We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you.
SH	He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled.
SH	a murderous attack?”
SH	I know that [NAME] [NAME] has been here.
SH	I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
SH	“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
SH	He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking.
SH	We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.”
SH	“It must be recovered.”
SH	Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.
SH	Together we rushed into the room.
SH	That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket.
SH	A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of [NAME].
SH	“Nor running a chance of arrest?”
SH	She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
SH	I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution.
SH	He’s a young man, [NAME] [NAME], but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in [NAME].
SH	“Thank you.
SH	“I did not say a probable one.
SH	But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”
SH	“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady.
SH	I nodded to show that I had heard.
SH	“He doesn’t look a credit to the [NAME] [NAME] cells, does he?”
SH	She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
SH	“He knows it already.
SH	“‘Undoubtedly so.
SH	Still, of course, in [NAME] they look upon these things in a different way.”
SH	Whoa, there, whoa!”
SH	This is what began it all.
SH	I am sorry to have interrupted you.
SH	Would she not have made an admirable queen?
SH	“Had he ever spoken of [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields.
SH	“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked [NAME] [NAME], with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
SH	“‘Quite so.
SH	Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
SH	“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered.
SH	My dear wife knew that I had business in the [NAME].
SH	You knew that this man [NAME], the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
SH	I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager.
SH	And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him.
SH	Nothing but energy can save you.
SH	Both [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence.
SH	The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked.
SH	Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling.
SH	I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“My dear [NAME]!”
SH	“Good heavens!”
SH	Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible.
SH	I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	She has her freedom.”
SH	“Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee.
SH	And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”
SH	There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months.
SH	“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”
SH	“[NAME], my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!
SH	“But I am very much mistaken if this is not [NAME] [NAME] upon the left.”
SH	[NAME], I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
SH	It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before [NAME] came back.
SH	He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.
SH	When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’
SH	I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”
SH	As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
SH	I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] let me out when he came back before he went up to you.
SH	A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”
SH	Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man?
SH	He had even smoked there.
SH	“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“But why are you not conducting the case from [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	“I never have.”
SH	I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair.
SH	But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.”
SH	When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me.
SH	It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle [NAME] in [NAME].
SH	He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.
SH	“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”
SH	It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall.
SH	A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.
SH	Get out of this!”
SH	I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in [NAME].
SH	[NAME] [NAME] hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.
SH	I walked round the corner, saw the [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.
SH	Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.
SH	‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey.
SH	“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved.
SH	I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Hence those vows of [NAME] exacted upon a [NAME], and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding.
SH	My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.
SH	With a few grateful words to [NAME] she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.
SH	“I guessed as much.”
SH	That second window is the one that I jumped from.”
SH	My friend smiled.
SH	“There,” said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile.
SH	I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster.
SH	“I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
SH	One night—it was on the twentieth of [NAME], 1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”
SH	His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.
SH	“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give [NAME], the maid, leave to go out to-night?’
SH	Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that [NAME] was really dead.
SH	he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.
SH	“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked [NAME].
SH	On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
SH	You must lock yourself up from him to-night.
SH	Besides, what use was my hair to me?
SH	His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
SH	I often take advantage of the  freedom which it gives.
SH	From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons.
SH	I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it.
SH	As I came down the stairs I saw [NAME] herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.
SH	I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know.
SH	“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.”
SH	“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”
SH	He did tell me the address.
SH	“He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.”
SH	It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”
SH	“[NAME]! Born in [NAME] [NAME] in the year 1858.
SH	Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
SH	“You interest me extremely,” said [NAME].
SH	I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.
SH	But [NAME] shook his head gravely.
SH	I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions.
SH	“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”
SH	“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded [NAME].
SH	The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other.
SH	Here we are.
SH	There it is in a nutshell.
SH	I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of [NAME] from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
SH	The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
SH	How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”
SH	Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
SH	[NAME] shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced.
SH	“But his voice was just a little too coaxing.
SH	So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.
SH	“My last client of the sort was a king.”
SH	Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”
SH	It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen.
SH	I thought I heard a ring.”
SH	“When [NAME] [NAME] has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
SH	My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
SH	His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight.
SH	There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you.
SH	I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields.
SH	It was not in front.
SH	So I think, and so, too, thinks my little [NAME], who has a woman’s quick insight into character.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting.
SH	“Nothing?”  “Not a bite.
SH	I am the last court of appeal.”
SH	“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,” I answered.
SH	“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’
SH	“Thank you.
SH	Does that suggest anything?”
SH	I don’t know.”
SH	[NAME] was apparently the richer man, so [NAME] became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together.
SH	“By train from [NAME].”
SH	I dine at seven.
SH	“And where is it?”
SH	“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.
SH	“Quite so!
SH	“To the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], to be left till called for.
SH	Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
SH	“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes.
SH	“In that case I shall continue my professional round.
SH	Where are they?”
SH	You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’
SH	“A likely story!
SH	[NAME] THE FIVE [NAME] [NAME]  When I glance over my notes and records of the [NAME] [NAME] cases between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave.
SH	[NAME] was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me.
SH	Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike.
SH	“Will you bet, then?”
SH	“Oh, fresh and glossy.”
SH	I shouted, beside myself with rage.
SH	The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed.
SH	Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of.
SH	[NAME] went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
SH	At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
SH	“Quite so.
SH	It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.
SH	Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.
SH	“Yes,” said [NAME], answering the look rather than the words.
SH	What danger do you foresee?”
SH	I have caught you, have I?
SH	“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back.
SH	Down the centre of [NAME] [NAME] it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME], the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.
SH	In that, however, I was in error.
SH	Which was it?”
SH	It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”
SH	A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.”
SH	But I must be prompt over this matter.”
SH	said he, “where’s your daughter?”
SH	“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”
SH	If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most _[NAME]_ results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”
SH	“You will observe,” said [NAME], laying down the volume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of [NAME] from [NAME] with their papers.
SH	Never let yourself doubt upon that point.
SH	“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.
SH	“‘My dear young lady!
SH	And good-night, [NAME],” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.
SH	“Then I shall certainly come.”
SH	I think that we may judge [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position.
SH	[NAME] has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.
SH	What do you deduce from that?”
SH	I screamed, ‘you villain!
SH	“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector.
SH	[NAME] thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’[NAME].
SH	Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], with the exception of his coat.
SH	All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”
SH	But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”
SH	“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.
SH	In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”
SH	he gasped.
SH	“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”  “Who knows?
SH	Let me out!’
SH	“‘What papers?
SH	“Which of you is [NAME]?”
SH	“Nothing.”
SH	“There is serious news this morning,” [NAME] observed.
SH	In a quarter of an hour we were in [NAME] at the [NAME] [NAME], which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into [NAME].
SH	Now my theory all along has been that [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] was decoyed away by [NAME] [NAME], and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.
SH	You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an [NAME].
SH	She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication.
SH	I came to [NAME] [NAME] by the [NAME] and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow.
SH	We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.
SH	But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw [NAME] standing and looking at me out of the first pew.
SH	I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after.
SH	It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening.
SH	‘So it is,’ he cried.
SH	The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth _en [NAME]_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth.
SH	What of it, then?
SH	Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last message: ‘[NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”
SH	Two attempts of the sort have already been made.
SH	“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?”
SH	If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade.
SH	“I will do nothing of the kind.
SH	The letter which I hold in my hand is from [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late.
SH	“Why did you pick him?”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
SH	And the man who wrote the note is a German.
SH	“‘No friend of yours, [NAME] [NAME]?’
SH	One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
SH	Jump up here.
SH	“When did you first meet [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’  “‘Yes, [NAME]; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’
SH	[NAME] [NAME] had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
SH	We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
SH	“I am surprised that [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] has not already arrived.
SH	“‘[NAME],’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at [NAME] [NAME].’
SH	It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day.
SH	“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered.
SH	Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his [NAME] dinner.”
SH	He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs.
SH	For you, [NAME] [NAME], the stake will be some £ 30,000; and for you, [NAME], it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.”
SH	[NAME] sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.
SH	I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting.
SH	Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed [NAME].
SH	I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
SH	“’Pon my word, [NAME], you are coming along wonderfully.
SH	I shook my head.
SH	That was always the way.
SH	One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
SH	‘The [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME],’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’
SH	“Now, my dear sir,” said [NAME], “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?
SH	I had forgotten the strange pets which the [NAME] affected.
SH	At nine o’clock [NAME] called for us with the carriage, and we set off for [NAME] [NAME] and the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	There would be a noise like a pistol shot.
SH	We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
SH	I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.”
SH	“Will you go?”
SH	I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard.
SH	It may have been taken from him.”
SH	There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in [NAME]’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.
SH	For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
SH	As we rolled into [NAME] [NAME] we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
SH	This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy.
SH	“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”
SH	You did not see anyone else in the room?”
SH	A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
SH	My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder.
SH	Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.
SH	Same old platform.
SH	There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’
SH	He raised his hand.
SH	There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw [NAME], pale, [NAME], and unkempt, staring out at me.
SH	“‘You doubt its value?’
SH	Far away we could hear the deep tones of the [NAME] clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.
SH	“But she will refuse.”
SH	Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number.
SH	We sat in silence for some minutes, [NAME] more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.
SH	As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
SH	“Now, [NAME] [NAME], you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.
SH	“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”
SH	There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.”
SH	The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘[NAME]!’
SH	“There is the writing.”
SH	“I only looked in as I passed,” said he.
SH	A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
SH	Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house.
SH	It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.
SH	And the [NAME] go out to-night?”
SH	I stood firm.
SH	Yet, with all this, you  made me reveal what you wanted to know.
SH	Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.
SH	The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”
SH	Your recent services to one of the royal houses of [NAME] have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
SH	I am going through the [NAME] first, and we can have some lunch on the way.
SH	“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.”
SH	He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sat up with a whistle.
SH	“It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he.
SH	I had no idea.
SH	A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper.
SH	But what is this written above them?’
SH	She responded beautifully.
SH	As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other.
SH	It was worth an effort to preserve it.
SH	He put less weight upon it.
SH	“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation.
SH	There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house.
SH	“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation.
SH	Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of [NAME] pointed to one of the most expensive hotels.
SH	One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met [NAME] [NAME] coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed.
SH	“One moment,” said [NAME], “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound?
SH	“Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.”
SH	Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.
SH	They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor.
SH	“I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.”
SH	It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at [NAME], and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
SH	As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists.
SH	He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.”
SH	Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.
SH	As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to [NAME] a morose and disappointed man.
SH	To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether [NAME] [NAME] would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”
SH	He caught up a pen.
SH	“He stood,” said [NAME], “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”
SH	As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.
SH	“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.
SH	At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.
SH	Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in [NAME].
SH	“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor.
SH	You are doing what you can for him and for me.
SH	I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling.
SH	He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.
SH	I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.”
SH	You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you.
SH	He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at [NAME], and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.
SH	“Yes, my stepfather.
SH	“Never mind,” said [NAME], laughing; “it is my business to know things.
SH	He wished us to leave him alone.
SH	“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always.
SH	“Well, have you solved it?”
SH	“Your boy, [NAME], went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
SH	It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in [NAME], and his father did not know where he was.
SH	In the meantime [NAME] [NAME], we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”
SH	On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some [NAME] 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”
SH	And, I say, [NAME], there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.”
SH	“Surely this is not your husband’s writing, madam.”
SH	“I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said.
SH	Might I not escort her to this place?
SH	I am all off colour.
SH	Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.
SH	[NAME] kept two servants—a man and a girl.
SH	“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said [NAME].
SH	“He has written to me to say that he would be here at six.
SH	As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.
SH	“I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world.
SH	I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”
SH	It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data.
SH	And what conclusions did the coroner come to?”
SH	It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him.
SH	[NAME] and I stay at home.
SH	One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return.
SH	Well, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.”
SH	These flat brims curled at the edge came in then.
SH	It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.
SH	Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you.
SH	The case would then never go into court at all.”
SH	“You have done well indeed!”
SH	There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”
SH	You have made two blunders in as many minutes.
SH	Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you.
SH	I think that I could be of assistance to you.”
SH	“I know where it is.”
SH	“Well, that is clear enough, certainly.
SH	“‘Certainly not.’
SH	[NAME] shrugged his shoulders.
SH	“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said [NAME]  “‘Precisely.’
SH	[NAME] forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.
SH	“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again.
SH	How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down.
SH	No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us.
SH	“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”
SH	At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity.
SH	[NAME] lets him loose every night, and [NAME] help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon.
SH	“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid.
SH	this, I suppose, is he.
SH	“And for present expenses?”
SH	I have a fairly long list at present.”
SH	It is pleasant to me to observe, [NAME], that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.”
SH	Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”
SH	“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address.
SH	“Oh, I’m in such trouble!”
SH	I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so.
SH	I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.”
SH	THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND  On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend [NAME] [NAME], I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
SH	I am so frightened about him!”
SH	“‘What is it, uncle?’
SH	It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.
SH	Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.
SH	And in practice again, I observe.
SH	“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our client, rising.
SH	The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the [NAME] for ‘Company.’
SH	What an exposure!
SH	“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
SH	I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
SH	A maid rushed across and threw open the window.
SH	There was not a bird to be seen there.
SH	The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it.
SH	“Well?” she cried, “well?”
SH	Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
SH	What else could she do?
SH	“Well, but [NAME]?”
SH	What do you think of such a commission as that?’
SH	You want to know what became of those geese?”
SH	You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”
SH	“I did as I was told, and at the same instant [NAME] [NAME] drew down the blind.
SH	Not more than is usual in my family.”
SH	I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend.
SH	He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter.
SH	It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.
SH	“You have no chance at all.”
SH	And now we must be silent and wait.”
SH	I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’
SH	Just before nine o’clock [NAME] [NAME] stepped briskly into the room.
SH	“What is the meaning of it all, [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.”
SH	It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the _[NAME] [NAME]_.
SH	In the pocket is a card-case.
SH	You are screening your stepfather.”
SH	With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was.
SH	“A thousand pounds!
SH	“‘What do you call purely nominal?’
SH	Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise.
SH	“I am a dying man,” said old [NAME].
SH	It is a little souvenir from the [NAME] of [NAME] in return for my assistance in the case of the [NAME] [NAME] papers.”
SH	“She showed me, as I told you she would.”
SH	We travelled by the [NAME] as far as [NAME]; and a short walk took us to [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME], the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning.
SH	“He was a very shy man, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	The metallic [NAME] heard by [NAME] [NAME] was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
SH	Surely your medical experience would tell you, [NAME], that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”
SH	There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.
SH	“What?”  “I am no official agent.
SH	‘I shall expect you, then, at [NAME] at 11:15.’
SH	‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
SH	Where is your father’s place of business?”
SH	“I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one.
SH	THE ADVENTURE OF THE [NAME]’S [NAME]  Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of [NAME] [NAME]’s thumb, and that of [NAME] [NAME]’s madness.
SH	It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats.
SH	“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle.
SH	“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?”
SH	Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.
SH	“And you were surprised to see him in [NAME] [NAME]?”  “Very much so.”
SH	“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.”
SH	You will sign it, and [NAME] here can witness it.
SH	“Thank [NAME] for that.
SH	“Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre.
SH	“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of [NAME] again.
SH	The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body.
SH	‘This is all quite beside the question.
SH	“[NAME], then.”
SH	If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”
SH	I found [NAME] [NAME] alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair.
SH	In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
SH	“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly.
SH	“How did he come?”
SH	[NAME] was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road.
SH	“He says four o’clock.
SH	So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers.
SH	One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable.
SH	My room at The [NAME] is a double-bedded one.”
SH	“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”  “No, I never heard of her using it.
SH	The latter is always instructive.
SH	“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature.
SH	“Oh, no, sir.
SH	But he could not help me in any way.
SH	It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the [NAME] to the north and west.
SH	“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.
SH	You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position.
SH	“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”
SH	“‘Entirely.’
SH	I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers.
SH	He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.
SH	in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech.
SH	We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, [NAME] woman entered the room.
SH	Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
SH	I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”
SH	“In which, sir?”
SH	Oh, if you do, [NAME] [NAME], do tell him that I know him to be innocent.”
SH	Is the security sufficient?’  “‘Ample.’
SH	Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
SH	I would do it again.
SH	The daughter told us as much.
SH	“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”
SH	I only doubt—’  “‘The propriety of my leaving it.
SH	‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’
SH	“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked [NAME] when our visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable.
SH	Anybody bringing,” &[NAME], &[NAME]  “That will do,” said [NAME].
SH	“Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”
SH	[NAME] had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also.
SH	“You work your own method, and I shall work mine.
SH	Would you give me an introduction to him?”
SH	To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.
SH	They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers.
SH	It might be a lover; it might be a husband.
SH	That fatal night [NAME] [NAME] had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.
SH	My father was a schoolmaster in [NAME], where I received an excellent education.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door.
SH	“The gentleman I describe.”
SH	“There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.
SH	We should have acted before this.
SH	I took it up and glanced at it.
SH	“You are right,” he cried; “I am the [NAME].
SH	A precious stone.
SH	The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had last been seen.
SH	Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the [NAME].
SH	“You want to go home, no doubt, [NAME],” he remarked as we emerged.
SH	“A patient!” said she.
SH	“Good heavens!”
SH	Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in [NAME] [NAME].
SH	This business has had a very bad effect upon him.
SH	“I wish to have a quiet word with you, [NAME].”
SH	He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.
SH	It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.”
SH	I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
SH	That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables.
SH	But you will find that all I say is really to the point.
SH	I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him.
SH	Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face!
SH	These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine.
SH	“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you.
SH	But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”
SH	[NAME] and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
SH	“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”
SH	“I beg [NAME].”
SH	I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
SH	My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it.
SH	I did not wonder at [NAME]’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in [NAME] [NAME]’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young [NAME]’s innocence.
SH	I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him.
SH	“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”
SH	“Let me see!” said [NAME].
SH	Now we can talk in safety.’
SH	They spoke of those hours of burrowing.
SH	“And who is this [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	“Well, [NAME] was going off to [NAME] again in a week, and [NAME] wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone.
SH	The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily.
SH	“That’s better!” said he.
SH	“But it is profoundly true.
SH	I have it here and I will read it to you:
SH	“Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.
SH	The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
SH	I never noticed that before.”
SH	“It is a nice household,” he murmured.
SH	“Then I do not see the point.”
SH	I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”
SH	“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”
SH	But will he see it?”
SH	In the second one which I visited in [NAME] [NAME], I learned by an inspection of the book that [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill.
SH	It is most important, all the same.
SH	And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
SH	Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”
SH	“Thank you!”
SH	“I think that I had better go, [NAME].”
SH	That is clear and concise.”
SH	Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?
SH	“I suppose, [NAME],” said he, “that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”
SH	As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me?
SH	“You may place considerable confidence in [NAME] [NAME], sir,” said the police agent loftily.
SH	“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”
SH	“Oh, I have my hand upon him.
SH	“‘There is a drive, then?’  “‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country.
SH	[NAME], [NAME], jump, and I’ll swing for it!”
SH	During all the years that he lived at [NAME], I doubt if ever he set foot in the town.
SH	And so you won’t cut your hair?’
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.
SH	“Could he throw no light?”
SH	It was found in the banks of the [NAME] [NAME] in southern [NAME] and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red.
SH	In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
SH	I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’
SH	This way, please!”
SH	“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped [NAME].
SH	“Would you?
SH	“Bring me the books, [NAME],” said he.
SH	He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family.
SH	Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it.
SH	And now, [NAME], we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play.
SH	His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, [NAME] neck.
SH	“‘There are none missing.
SH	“But how will you look?”
SH	Let me explain.
SH	“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find.
SH	“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed.
SH	He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.
SH	They were a gang, and a rough one, too.
SH	One night—it was in [NAME], ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock.
SH	“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner.
SH	If the latter, it was less likely.
SH	The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers.
SH	I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical.
SH	My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress.
SH	His dress was rich with a richness which would, in [NAME], be looked upon as akin to bad taste.
SH	He placed his finger in the centre of the circle.
SH	You have been of material assistance to me.”
SH	He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
SH	I thought it as well to have [NAME] with us also.
SH	What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of [NAME] to this most pitiable pass?
SH	The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
SH	And, first, as to how it came here.
SH	“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up.
SH	“Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
SH	“Excuse me, I know everything of it.
SH	It was from her that I had your address.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
SH	‘You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.
SH	The solemn [NAME] [NAME] perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while [NAME] fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones.
SH	“Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.
SH	“I think, [NAME],” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.”
SH	Why should they give you [NAME] 120 a year, when they could have their pick for £ 40?
SH	There was no truth, [NAME] [NAME], in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”
SH	It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.
SH	You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink.
SH	“You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins.
SH	“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen face.
SH	I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night.
SH	he shrieked, and then, ‘My [NAME], my [NAME], my sins have overtaken me!’
SH	‘Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he.
SH	The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.
SH	His manner was not effusive.
SH	It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness.
SH	We have boxed the compass among us.
SH	he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion.
SH	You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”
SH	“A considerable crime is in contemplation.
SH	“All right,” said [NAME] quietly.
SH	[NAME] went there at [NAME] two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged.
SH	“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed [NAME] [NAME] gloomily.
SH	With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.
SH	“But the reason is very obvious.
SH	“They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother.
SH	I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”
SH	“You see, but you do not observe.
SH	[NAME] 9, 1890.”
SH	The [NAME] [NAME], which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the [NAME] [NAME] and the private park of the wealthy [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”
SH	She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.
SH	At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death.
SH	Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.
SH	“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for.
SH	He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
SH	I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”
SH	I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick.
SH	“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me with a sneer.
SH	It was in the latter days of [NAME], and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence.
SH	“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.
SH	But what in the name of the devil!”
SH	‘It is [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],’ said [NAME]  “He looked inside the envelope.
SH	Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?”
SH	No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted.
SH	I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.
SH	Are you sure that everything is fastened?’
SH	“No; a client.
SH	This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”
SH	You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.”
SH	You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop.
SH	It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather.
SH	“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
SH	“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked.
SH	And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of [NAME], and how the best plans of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] were beaten by a woman’s wit.
SH	But I think I have the key of the affair now.”
SH	“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up.
SH	Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal.
SH	A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure.
SH	Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?”
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] said something about ‘jumping a claim.’
SH	He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.
SH	The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
SH	In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the [NAME].
SH	“But his left-handedness.”
SH	I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”
SH	“You shut up the windows and doors the night before.
SH	It is of importance.
SH	When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.”
SH	“[NAME], [NAME],” said [NAME], smiling, “perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune.
SH	“So it appears.”
SH	You should be ashamed of yourself!”
SH	It was empty.
SH	The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.
SH	At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the [NAME] [NAME], a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction.
SH	Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet.
SH	I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those.
SH	“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”
SH	Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”
SH	The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
SH	And yet this [NAME] [NAME] seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the [NAME].”
SH	I have  determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in  reference to the very painful event which has occurred in  connection with my wedding.
SH	There has been no result.”
SH	The whole garden has already been minutely examined.”
SH	She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two [NAME] quarrelling near [NAME] [NAME], and that she was afraid that they were going to fight.
SH	And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.
SH	I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.
SH	The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist.
SH	Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this.
SH	“Not invisible but unnoticed, [NAME].
SH	“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
SH	She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met [NAME] [NAME] at a friend’s house.
SH	you find it so?”
SH	“And the ring?”
SH	Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.
SH	I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in [NAME].’
SH	It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’
SH	He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
SH	I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with [NAME] [NAME].
SH	[NAME] gazed long and earnestly at it.
SH	In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.
SH	“Has he come with you to-night?”
SH	I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar.
SH	It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn.
SH	I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.
SH	Three gilt balls and a brown board with “[NAME] [NAME]” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
SH	I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever  again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you  forever.
SH	“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”
SH	what a blind fool I have been!
SH	He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the [NAME] and myself.
SH	And here comes the country surgeon and [NAME] [NAME], so I think, [NAME], that we had best escort [NAME] [NAME] back to [NAME], as it seems to me that our _[NAME] [NAME]_ now is rather a questionable one.”
SH	“It’s more than a precious stone.
SH	“And I have some business to do which will take some hours.
SH	I congratulate you warmly.”
SH	You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief.
SH	All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take [NAME] 2.
SH	“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”
SH	“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he.
SH	The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.
SH	Very few governesses in [NAME] are getting £ 100 a year.
SH	“It came by the last post,” said he.
SH	At least that was my first impression.
SH	“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
SH	I know that her word is inviolate.
SH	“And you thought he was pulled back?”
SH	“My photograph.”
SH	“What is it, then?”
SH	I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.
SH	Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell.
SH	Here it is, and you can read for yourself.”
SH	“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he.
SH	I want the doctor’s advice and help, too.
SH	“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued [NAME], pointing at the bare slabs of marble.
SH	“There is no possible getting out of it, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Perhaps, [NAME] [NAME], you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?”
SH	“That is well.
SH	If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your [NAME].
SH	Palmer and [NAME] were among the heads of their profession.
SH	Some friend of yours, perhaps?”  “Except yourself I have none,” he answered.
SH	The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”
SH	And yet it would be the blackest treachery to [NAME] to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
SH	What does her clever stepfather do then?
SH	“Oh, [NAME] would do your work for you.
SH	Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
SH	I paid the man and hurried into the church.
SH	He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
SH	“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves!
SH	What could it be?
SH	THE [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]  We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram.
SH	And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’
SH	I have not seen a paper for some days.”
SH	“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
SH	and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’
SH	“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he.
SH	I knew that it was my sister’s voice.
SH	“Experience,” said [NAME], laughing.
SH	On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.
SH	“And [NAME]’s address?” he asked.
SH	As to the photograph, your client may rest in  peace.
SH	he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
SH	“What steps will you take?”
SH	Your niece knew nothing of such men.
SH	I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
SH	No wind, and not a cloud in the sky.
SH	I should become the laughing-stock of [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
SH	The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now.
SH	[NAME] walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.
SH	I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
SH	“‘In my own bureau.’
SH	We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative.
SH	He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives.
SH	In the card-case is a note.
SH	At dusk we saw [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.
SH	Heavy bands of [NAME] were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.
SH	It is the [NAME] who is so uncourteous to his verbs.
SH	The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
SH	It was mere chance that he was within earshot.
SH	A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform.
SH	[NAME] wrote those words.”
SH	He rose as he spoke.
SH	“I’ve wasted time enough,” said [NAME], rising.
SH	I thought there might be some weapon or other trace.
SH	I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.
SH	“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, [NAME] [NAME],” [NAME] continued.
SH	“‘[NAME] [NAME],’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’
SH	Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it.
SH	The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”
SH	But I am inclined to think neither.
SH	“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to [NAME] [NAME]’s chamber?”  “Exactly so.
SH	Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.
SH	I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the [NAME], entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me.
SH	But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”
SH	I am glad to see that [NAME] [NAME] has had the good sense to light the fire.
SH	Posted to-day in [NAME] by a man with a dirty thumb.
SH	He’ll crack a crib in [NAME] one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in [NAME] the next.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.
SH	“Yes, I have been dragging the [NAME].”
SH	“And you don’t know his address?”
SH	“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, [NAME]?’ he stammered.
SH	Even after I became  suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old  clergyman.
SH	“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’
SH	Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”
SH	Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for  the [NAME] to see my husband.
SH	“But what is it you wish?”
SH	I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.
SH	Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.
SH	“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”
SH	We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before.
SH	Now where did they come from?”
SH	One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was [NAME] [NAME], a game-keeper in the employ of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“And now there is only she to be described.
SH	Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”
SH	That carries us right on to the other block.
SH	What will he say when he returns?”
SH	I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room.
SH	“It means that it is all over,” [NAME] answered.
SH	It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.
SH	“No, he was averse to it also.
SH	“‘That would suit me very well,’ said [NAME]
SH	If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.”
SH	“And leave your case unfinished?”
SH	“Very well.
SH	It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
SH	“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
SH	shouted another.
SH	A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
SH	“I have given you the chance.
SH	“I do not think [NAME] would hurt a fly.”
SH	“May I see it?”
SH	Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
SH	His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.
SH	Wait in patience.—NEVILLE.’
SH	“Then he might have called to you?”
SH	‘I should be able to look after that for you.’
SH	I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room.
SH	On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”
SH	There is the first volume of it in that press.
SH	“All has turned out splendidly.
SH	“But you can know nothing of this?”
SH	“What can he hope to find there?
SH	It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair?
SH	“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your [NAME],” said [NAME] coldly.
SH	“It is very clear.”
SH	The largest landed proprietor in that part is a [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], who made his money in [NAME] and returned some years ago to the old country.
SH	A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket.
SH	Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country.
SH	I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to [NAME] by the evening train.”
SH	You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”
SH	“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.”
SH	“How do you know, then?”
SH	But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost.
SH	My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to [NAME] with [NAME] [NAME], the groom.
SH	“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said [NAME], laughing.
SH	The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
SH	“And your father?” asked [NAME].
SH	“To the police?”  “No; I shall be my own police.
SH	He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words.
SH	“I was aware of it,” said [NAME] dryly.
SH	“And yet I question, [NAME], whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.”
SH	From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight [NAME] suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
SH	The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result.
SH	It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”
SH	“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you.
SH	Consider what is involved by your theory.
SH	“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation.
SH	“He travels for [NAME] & [NAME], the great [NAME] importers of [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant.
SH	“You heard nothing yourself last night?”
SH	Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.
SH	It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.
SH	“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’
SH	“Here?”  “Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved.
SH	What could that mean?
SH	The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], at [NAME] [NAME], where breakfast had been prepared.
SH	It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man.
SH	Even his voice was gentle.
SH	“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was choked with red-headed folk, and [NAME]’s [NAME] looked like a coster’s orange barrow.
SH	“No bad?”  “No.”
SH	The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”
SH	“It’s quite too funny.
SH	His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left.
SH	he asked in a quavering voice.
SH	Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.
SH	A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.
SH	It was from [NAME] [NAME] and ran in this way:  “Have you a couple of days to spare?
SH	“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.
SH	Then he became a little more reasonable.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] tells me that I may  place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.
SH	He shook hands with us and took his leave.
SH	“[NAME], then,” said the old man solemnly.
SH	Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.”
SH	Now carry out my orders to the letter.”
SH	“I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.
SH	“It’s nothing of the kind.”
SH	If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself!
SH	To [NAME] [NAME] she is always _the_ woman.
SH	That bears out his story.
SH	These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by [NAME] [NAME].
SH	How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?
SH	Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
SH	“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s business at [NAME] [NAME], near the [NAME].
SH	And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] and your niece [NAME].
SH	“I am delighted to hear it,” he said.
SH	He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the [NAME] had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
SH	“When did it break out?”
SH	He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve.
SH	He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
SH	It is the first [NAME] night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”
SH	“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said [NAME] laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
SH	“There is one other thing you owe, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME] rather sternly.
SH	“‘Here we are, [NAME],’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you.
SH	When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.
SH	You then—”  [NAME] threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees.
SH	In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Of what?”  “My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?”
SH	The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual.
SH	“[NAME], he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.
SH	Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.
SH	“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.
SH	I sent [NAME], the coachman, to watch you,  ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came  down just as you departed.
SH	You see this little book?”
SH	And now let us talk about [NAME] [NAME], if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”
SH	It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.”
SH	I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
SH	I have given you all the facts.
SH	If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?”
SH	Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour.
SH	The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.
SH	May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?”
SH	And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view.
SH	“It is very essential, [NAME] [NAME],” said he, “that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”
SH	As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.
SH	“But you are joking.
SH	There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow.
SH	“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
SH	“Nearly eleven.”
SH	This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.”
SH	It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.
SH	“Then, good-night, your [NAME], and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.
SH	“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”
SH	I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast.
SH	Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it.
SH	“And you may expect us early in the afternoon.
SH	“This concluded the examination of the witness.”
SH	We neither of us care for it.”
SH	“I should not be surprised if that were he.
SH	“Oh, it won’t do—really it wo[NAME],” said [NAME] suavely.
SH	When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.”
SH	[NAME] dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.
SH	I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.”
SH	“Here is the first notice which I can find.
SH	The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at.
SH	He held up a piece of [NAME] [NAME] about the size of a sheet of note-paper.
SH	And now, [NAME], this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to [NAME].
SH	You have made your statement very clearly.
SH	But this one comes from [NAME], and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”
SH	It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it.
SH	He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities.
SH	“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.
SH	The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], I was arrested as his murderer.
SH	“A fair dowry.
SH	I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.”
SH	“But without his collar or tie.
SH	Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
SH	“You have the photograph?”
SH	He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us.
SH	“Yes, her father brought her over for this last [NAME] season.
SH	“You speak of danger.
SH	It is her carriage.
SH	Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
SH	“The paper was made in [NAME],” I said.
SH	she asked, facing round to me.
SH	He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice.
SH	If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”
SH	There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what [NAME] [NAME] had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever.
SH	“At what time?”  “Ten will be early enough.”
SH	I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.
SH	At first, of course, he denied everything.
SH	I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.”
SH	She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.
SH	“Then comes our expedition of to-day.
SH	How could you know anything of the matter?”
SH	“It’s a bonny thing,” said he.
SH	“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.
SH	He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
SH	“_Nous verrons_,” answered [NAME] calmly.
SH	I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
SH	“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”
SH	“Do you go out much in society?”
SH	“Nothing.”
SH	He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
SH	“His face fell immediately.
SH	There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady.
SH	There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
SH	“Ah! that is suggestive.
SH	“Then you may entirely rely on me.”
SH	But you’ve got mixed, [NAME], for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many.
SH	“Indeed,” said [NAME].
SH	[NAME] [NAME]_ was there in [NAME], ’85, my suspicion became a certainty.
SH	“Oh, no, not now.
SH	He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age.
SH	“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted.
SH	[NAME] and [NAME] were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
SH	This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”
SH	“[NAME]! that was unfortunate.
SH	“Well then, I shan’t tell you.
SH	“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”
SH	And what do you intend to do?”
SH	The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle.
SH	She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”
SH	Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.
SH	“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man.
SH	Your wedding was arranged, then, for the [NAME].
SH	Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”
SH	“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.”
SH	I asked, smiling.
SH	He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
SH	“My face lengthened at this, [NAME] [NAME], for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
SH	“[NAME]! data!
SH	[NAME] [NAME] then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”
SH	she cried breathlessly.
SH	“‘And what are they worth?’
SH	I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, [NAME] [NAME], I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] could not come to the house any more.”
SH	A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.
SH	You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary.
SH	“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm.
SH	“What can it mean?”
SH	But, dear me!
SH	The other was his singular dying reference to a rat.
SH	“Ah, of course, I forgot that.
SH	“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
SH	I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me.
SH	“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so  formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you  call to-morrow.
SH	“It is a curious thing,” remarked [NAME], “that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting.
SH	[NAME], too, quite unusual boots!
SH	he remarked, looking up in surprise.
SH	And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”
SH	“There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.
SH	“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”
SH	My father had a small factory at [NAME], which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling.
SH	[NAME] was for the moment as startled as I.
SH	[NAME] had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“How did you trace it, then?”
SH	“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror.
SH	He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
SH	Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same [NAME], very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“I am ashamed of you, [NAME],” said [NAME] with dignity after a few minutes’ silence.
SH	“Your presence might be invaluable.”
SH	Even though he knew that [NAME] had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.
SH	It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
SH	“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?”
SH	I ask you not merely because my friend [NAME] [NAME] has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
SH	Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then [NAME] went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to [NAME]
SH	I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven.
SH	What is this, then?
SH	Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are  very light.
SH	I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him.
SH	“I am following you closely,” I answered.
SH	Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to [NAME] but which I thought it well to perform myself that night.
SH	“That would be unnecessary.
SH	Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, [NAME] [NAME]?
SH	“Just look it up, then.”
SH	“You’re angry, [NAME],” said she.
SH	It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”
SH	I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”
SH	Let me see it.”
SH	Of my mother!
SH	“But you have read the evidence.
SH	Retired from operatic stage—ha!
SH	“I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening.
SH	Here are your lodgings.
SH	How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market?
SH	There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up.
SH	“He might.”
SH	And your address?”
SH	And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late [NAME] [NAME], of dubious and questionable memory.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.
SH	He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle.
SH	“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’
SH	Some of the general public were present, then?”
SH	“I will not look.”
SH	There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of [NAME] [NAME]’ finger-tips upon the edge of the table.
SH	The place we want must be somewhere near that line.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume.
SH	Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at night.”
SH	Who do you give your casting vote to?”
SH	“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.
SH	And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door.
SH	“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in [NAME].
SH	“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
SH	“The police have watched this [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved.
SH	Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but [NAME] was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine.
SH	“Are they not fresh and beautiful?”
SH	We descended and started off once more for [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Will you be ready to-morrow?’
SH	At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.
SH	“But how?”  “I am about to be married.”
SH	Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold [NAME] chain, and [NAME] [NAME] tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.
SH	“What! where?” shouted [NAME] [NAME], turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
SH	‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’
SH	I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for [NAME] to know.”
SH	Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish [NAME] of Devonshire fashion over her ear.
SH	This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right.
SH	I did not know what to do.
SH	I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.
SH	before he knew that his son had returned.
SH	“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes.
SH	“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table.
SH	That is easily done.
SH	I call him mine, but really old [NAME], my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him.
SH	“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one.
SH	You have him here?”
SH	“They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.
SH	It is one of these cases—but, [NAME], here is Lestrade!
SH	His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.
SH	He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.
SH	“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the [NAME] [NAME],” I remarked.
SH	“I am sure that you are right, [NAME] [NAME],” cried our client.
SH	“Not in the least.
SH	A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a [NAME].
SH	I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.
SH	Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
SH	It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.”
SH	“He has come back and done it.
SH	One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
SH	I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me.
SH	There is a distinct element of danger.”
SH	[NAME], then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.
SH	I had seen little of [NAME] lately.
SH	and ‘What will you take for the geese?’
SH	Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly.
SH	“I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.”
SH	I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction.
SH	“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.
SH	What was that?”
SH	That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to [NAME].
SH	[NAME] keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
SH	In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes.
SH	Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room.
SH	His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks.
SH	This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany.
SH	I tell you that.
SH	Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a  suspicion.
SH	There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock.
SH	“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’ said he.
SH	It is most refreshingly unusual.
SH	I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours.
SH	Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, [NAME], and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”
SH	He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words.
SH	Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.
SH	“Then how many are there?”
SH	Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
SH	“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”
SH	Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
SH	We must come back to that.
SH	“No good news?”  “None.”
SH	When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’
SH	He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.
SH	The [NAME] [NAME] is an inn of repute in the [NAME] [NAME], at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us.
SH	When the inspector and a constable entered the house, [NAME], who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft.
SH	“It is straight enough.
SH	He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
SH	All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Then [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] came to ’[NAME], and we came to [NAME], and a marriage was arranged, and [NAME] was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor [NAME].
SH	“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he.
SH	Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”
SH	Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge.
SH	I looked at it before,” said [NAME].
SH	“Not at all.
SH	“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.”
SH	In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
SH	“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.
SH	Charming rural place.
SH	Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.
SH	Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally [NAME] who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me.
SH	He answered that the name was new to him.
SH	“‘Never,’ said [NAME]  “‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’
SH	That is just my point.
SH	“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
SH	“Was he in favour of such a union?”
SH	This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac.
SH	In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the [NAME] side.
SH	“That is unusual in a young girl.”
SH	With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.
SH	So long was he that [NAME] [NAME] and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.
SH	“They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the _[NAME] membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.
SH	“You are fatigued with your haste.
SH	“‘Never.’  “‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’
SH	“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’
SH	When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.
SH	“That sounds a little paradoxical.”
SH	If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’
SH	He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
SH	My practice is never very absorbing.”
SH	“And what did you learn from him?”
SH	Only one man knew my secret.
SH	“I shall jot down the facts.
SH	There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them.
SH	“Most certainly it does.
SH	The method was no doubt suggested to [NAME]’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair.
SH	“Very likely not.
SH	For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
SH	“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.
SH	As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], if I remember right, who was said to have gone to [NAME].
SH	There was the point from which all my adventures started.
SH	I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.
SH	“Frankly, now!”
SH	“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms.
SH	The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?
SH	I already feel it closing in upon me.
SH	Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
SH	We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to.
SH	I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.
SH	Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
SH	What can you gather from this old battered felt?”
SH	“For two days after my arrival at the [NAME] Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, [NAME] [NAME] came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
SH	No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate.
SH	They have laid for five.”
SH	“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
SH	“I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”
SH	Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs.
SH	He was at work again.
SH	Besides, it is the season of forgiveness.
SH	No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.
SH	I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”
SH	“The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places.
SH	He’s a remarkable man, is young [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Above all, try to let [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.”
SH	A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door.
SH	“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector.
SH	Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?
SH	I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.”
SH	Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that [NAME] [NAME] has to tell.”
SH	“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears.
SH	“Name the sum, and I will pay it.”
SH	What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?
SH	How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
SH	“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”
SH	He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity.
SH	“And the cigar-holder?”  “I could see that the end had not been in his mouth.
SH	And which king?”
SH	“And the papers?” asked the [NAME] hoarsely.
SH	“By all means.”
SH	He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
SH	“The [NAME]: What do you mean?
SH	I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere.
SH	“Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
SH	Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”
SH	“‘What, you dig [NAME]-earth in the house?’
SH	“I regret that I have kept you waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair.
SH	I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature.
SH	It was early in [NAME] in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find [NAME] [NAME] standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.
SH	“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.
SH	He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way.
SH	We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me.
SH	The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but [NAME]’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
SH	“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said [NAME], “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of [NAME] should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”
SH	The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.
SH	By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp.
SH	Come this way, if you please.”
SH	It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from [NAME] [NAME], and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.
SH	“Quite so.
SH	We  are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or [NAME] 120 a year, so as to  recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may  cause you.
SH	He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech.
SH	“It is said that [NAME] [NAME], of the [NAME], is so ill that his life is despaired of.”
SH	“But I am so sure that he is innocent.
SH	I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
SH	The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice.
SH	‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’
SH	As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the [NAME] in [NAME], I was seized with a keen desire to see [NAME] again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
SH	Have you good authority for what you say?”
SH	I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
SH	“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’
SH	But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.
SH	“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship.
SH	“You have made your position very clear to me,” said [NAME].
SH	Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going.
SH	“Here it is.
SH	As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.
SH	“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.”
SH	In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising [NAME], of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I will keep your confession, and if [NAME] is condemned I shall be forced to use it.
SH	I have driven down to tell you so.
SH	“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young [NAME].
SH	I have taken you fully into my confidence now, [NAME] [NAME], and I have shown you how I trust you.’
SH	I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages.
SH	[NAME] said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as [NAME]
SH	“See here, [NAME]!
SH	I’ve had enough of it.
SH	“No?”  “Well, you know [NAME] didn’t like anything of the sort.
SH	“In view of your health, nothing.
SH	“Well, look at this!”
SH	I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’
SH	Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
SH	You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.”
SH	The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
SH	“Well, some hundreds of times.”
SH	I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.
SH	“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.
SH	“I have heard of you, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.
SH	I think that I have touched bottom at last, however.
SH	Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.
SH	And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?”
SH	“I shall most certainly do so.”
SH	“It is a most mysterious business.”
SH	“That is enough.”
SH	“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.”
SH	A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds.
SH	“[NAME], sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough.
SH	Of her I could see nothing.
SH	“You can see him very well.”
SH	She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
SH	I never went wrong before!
SH	“I trust that we are not too late,” said he.
SH	The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine.
SH	“I should wish to.”
SH	[NAME] slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
SH	An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
SH	“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].’
SH	“You’ll come with me, won’t you?”
SH	“Yes, sir.
SH	“[NAME],” I read.
SH	“Very good.
SH	“I think that I see my way to clearing [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME].
SH	“I answered that I had not.
SH	It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.’
SH	“Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.
SH	We are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted.
SH	There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one.
SH	Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.
SH	“It is possible.”
SH	There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of [NAME]’s [NAME], which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”
SH	I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred.
SH	Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’ quarter, [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], and so through [NAME] [NAME] into [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the [NAME] under my disguise.
SH	“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”
SH	cried [NAME] with enthusiasm.
SH	“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door.
SH	“Yes, [NAME]; for he had started to [NAME] just before it arrived.”
SH	A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
SH	Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”
SH	“I could do with much less than that, [NAME] [NAME], but you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them.
SH	“Yes, he did.”
SH	Pray continue your most interesting statement.”
SH	His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of [NAME] [NAME], his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.
SH	Spies and thieves!
SH	“Very sorry to knock you up, [NAME],” said he, “but it’s the common lot this morning.
SH	“Oh, he gives no trouble.
SH	I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house.
SH	“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather.
SH	“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’
SH	It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into [NAME], [NAME] still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.
SH	“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
SH	Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known [NAME] family of the [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”
SH	I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference.
SH	About 1869 or 1870 he came back to [NAME] and took a small estate in [NAME], near [NAME].
SH	“Thank you for this information,” said he.
SH	There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source.
SH	“How can you tell that?”
SH	“Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.”
SH	It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in [NAME] and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at [NAME] [NAME].
SH	The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor.
SH	‘It’s only [NAME], my mastiff.
SH	If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders.
SH	One of the farms which he held, that of [NAME], was let to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], who was also an ex-Australian.
SH	[NAME] was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.
SH	“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said [NAME].
SH	I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son.
SH	He has taken to his bed, and [NAME] [NAME] says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered.
SH	Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?
SH	My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring.
SH	“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”
SH	I confess that I was disappointed.
SH	I had hardly finished when [NAME] returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
SH	“To smoke,” he answered.
SH	“Indeed, I should have thought a little more.
SH	“‘No, I cannot!’
SH	“My name,” said he, “is [NAME] [NAME], but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business.
SH	When [NAME] laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years.
SH	“You know my method.
SH	These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat.
SH	Pray let me have the details.”
SH	A hundred and fifty guineas apiece.
SH	Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper!
SH	I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”
SH	Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table.
SH	“[NAME], no.
SH	Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.
SH	“Your conversation is most entertaining,” said he.
SH	If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.
SH	“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate.
SH	Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this.
SH	And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young [NAME].
SH	It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
SH	I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection.
SH	“Oh, yes, you can.
SH	“You didn’t know this dead man, [NAME].
SH	He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
SH	He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
SH	The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the [NAME].
SH	What was he doing there at all?
SH	You can leave your bag.”
SH	I fear that you have felt the draught.’
SH	“I daresay that if I had put [NAME] 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.
SH	But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I  began to think.
SH	She is herself the very soul of delicacy.
SH	“[NAME], no, there’s life in him!”
SH	It had ceased ere
SH	At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “[NAME]!”
SH	It seems that it was.
SH	But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”
SH	Did he make no attempt to see you?”
SH	It was useless, however.
SH	Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag.
SH	Was it all to go for nothing?
SH	“You have it!”
SH	Or should you rather that I sent [NAME] off to bed?”
SH	“You are all wrong.”
SH	Your [NAME], as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.”
SH	“Well, let us hope so.
SH	I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself.
SH	She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.
SH	“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
SH	They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions.
SH	“Then put on your hat and come.
SH	But I don’t know why it should be tied.”
SH	You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] did so, and [NAME], after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.
SH	Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.
SH	“I was sure that I might rely on you.”
SH	She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
SH	“Yes,” I answered, laughing.
SH	“Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.
SH	And now let us consider another point.
SH	The [NAME] [NAME], five miles on the far side of [NAME].
SH	“Absolutely none.”
SH	“‘Have you never heard of the [NAME] of the Red-headed Men?’
SH	“By no means.”
SH	His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character.
SH	It is founded upon the observation of trifles.”
SH	Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.
SH	The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and [NAME] was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning.
SH	The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.
SH	When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’
SH	He said that he had never heard of any such body.
SH	Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the [NAME].
SH	“You are very kind, [NAME] [NAME], but I cannot do that.
SH	I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted.
SH	I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern.
SH	Do you think that you could perform one more feat?
SH	[NAME] [NAME], as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.
SH	“Very well.
SH	“And why?”  “I think that I mentioned to you that the [NAME] kept a cheetah and a baboon.
SH	“I cannot imagine.”
SH	On returning, he found that [NAME] had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small [NAME] casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the [NAME] was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table.
SH	He’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage.
SH	“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw [NAME] with the coronet in his hands?”
SH	“The [NAME]: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
SH	She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother.
SH	“Now, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost.
SH	It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
SH	At [NAME] we were fortunate in catching a train for [NAME], where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely [NAME] lanes.
SH	Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church?
SH	Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.
SH	And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.
SH	“You hear!
SH	“I know you, you scoundrel!
SH	“You’ll have to go out.”
SH	“[NAME] here and I met in ’84, in [NAME]’s camp, near the [NAME], where [NAME] was working a claim.
SH	“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten.
SH	“Which are?”
SH	“Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour.
SH	They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.”
SH	“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the [NAME]; “nothing could be more successful.
SH	I could see a change in my uncle, however.
SH	“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”
SH	“It is not an English paper at all.
SH	He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood.
SH	Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-[NAME], [NAME], swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.
SH	“I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
SH	“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
SH	“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”
SH	“He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.
SH	I shall communicate with you.”
SH	“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”
SH	He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
SH	“My geese!”
SH	Now for the ‘Eg.’
SH	In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.
SH	I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
SH	His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.
SH	Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’
SH	cried [NAME], in intense excitement.
SH	“Oh, indeed!
SH	“That is not quite so common, is it?
SH	I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home.
SH	We have still time to take a train to [NAME] and see him to-night?”
SH	“My heart had turned to lead.
SH	“The murder was done with it.”
SH	“Oh, the cause is excellent!”
SH	[NAME] his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.
SH	Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of [NAME] [NAME]’s.”
SH	The instant that we heard it, [NAME] sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
SH	‘Arms: [NAME], three caltrops in chief over a fess sable.
SH	“This is my friend, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.”
SH	It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here.
SH	“If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”
SH	For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.
SH	there has been an enclosure here!”
SH	[NAME] wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without [NAME] knowing anything about it.
SH	You give me hopes?”
SH	Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”
SH	I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.
SH	“We have had the pleasure of making the [NAME]’s acquaintance,” said [NAME], and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.
SH	I am sorry that [NAME] [NAME] has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public.
SH	“Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it went to?”
SH	“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”
SH	He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.
SH	With these I journeyed down to [NAME] and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”
SH	THE ADVENTURE OF THE [NAME] [NAME]  I had called upon my friend [NAME] [NAME] upon the second morning after [NAME], with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked.
SH	Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”
SH	That was last [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”
SH	You must get home instantly and act.”
SH	“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old.
SH	He had nothing a few years ago.
SH	I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’
SH	The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire.
SH	“The grass was growing under it.
SH	“In mining.
SH	With your permission, [NAME] [NAME], we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”
SH	“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
SH	“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”
SH	“Ah, I have no data.
SH	At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand.
SH	“I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge.
SH	“And my son?
SH	“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.
SH	As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household.
SH	“[NAME],” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him.
SH	“Think of my father!
SH	They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”
SH	“[NAME]—that is the very word,” said [NAME].
SH	“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale.
SH	“Where did you address your letters, then?”
SH	A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
SH	The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”
SH	There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest.
SH	“Is it possible?”
SH	Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life.
SH	There was one about three miles off.
SH	“I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands with us warmly.
SH	I see nothing in that.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.
SH	“Get out!”
SH	“Have you an order to see him in prison?”
SH	Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’
SH	Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:  “The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”
SH	“You know me, then?”
SH	All right, [NAME]; we shall not need you.
SH	“You will excuse me,” said [NAME] blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
SH	Well, he has always answered me like that.
SH	It is to that remark that she refers in this note:  “‘MY [NAME] [NAME] feel that I have brought trouble upon you,  and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might  never have occurred.
SH	I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.
SH	He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one.
SH	What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was!
SH	“What then?”  “I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _
SH	“It is true that I have been generally successful.”
SH	[NAME] drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.
SH	Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured.
SH	“I do not know what to think.
SH	You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
SH	You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”
SH	An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders.
SH	“Precisely so.
SH	Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light.
SH	“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry.
SH	May we bring him in, marm?”
SH	And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”
SH	On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours.
SH	“A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.
SH	Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water.
SH	“But I would not have let the young man come to harm.
SH	I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
SH	His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
SH	[NAME] am very anxious to consult you as to whether I  should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to  me as governess.
SH	she cried in [NAME], ‘remember your promise after the last time.
SH	Our party is complete,” said [NAME], buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
SH	Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair.
SH	Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent.
SH	As I dressed I glanced at my watch.
SH	With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent could be.
SH	“No, thank goodness, she did not.”
SH	“The rest you will leave in our hands.”
SH	As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.”
SH	Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings.
SH	“That is [NAME] [NAME] in the cellar,” said she.
SH	“You must act, man, or you are lost.
SH	“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white [NAME], “you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.
SH	“[NAME] think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper?
SH	I will leave the country, [NAME].
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
SH	I think that was the chain of events, [NAME] [NAME]!”
SH	We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], who lives near [NAME], and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house.
SH	“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
SH	Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote [NAME]’s example.”
SH	There cannot be any missing,’ said he.
SH	“The vanishing of the lady.”
SH	“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”
SH	If they fire, [NAME], have no compunction about shooting them down.”
SH	“[NAME]!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman.
SH	[NAME] [NAME], or [NAME], rather, returns from her drive at seven.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] is married,” remarked [NAME].
SH	You know my methods.
SH	he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round.
SH	Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.
SH	[NAME] rose in his triumph and bent his head to look.
SH	I shall drop you a line before I leave.”
SH	He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post.
SH	And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
SH	But I hear the rumble of wheels.
SH	“Oh, well, he was very good about it.
SH	“[NAME], bodies, [NAME].
SH	“I am all attention, madam.”
SH	“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man.
SH	“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle.
SH	Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow.
SH	“One day a gold convoy came down from [NAME] to [NAME], and we lay in wait for it and attacked it.
SH	She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction.
SH	With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
SH	How dare you touch that coronet?’
SH	It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point.
SH	There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the [NAME]’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.
SH	But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”
SH	“‘No, I have not.
SH	When I came down, [NAME] [NAME] met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’
SH	We were engaged after the first walk that we took.
SH	“And you can do nothing until then?”
SH	“I shall never see them again!”
SH	“[NAME] so; but the sequel was rather unusual.
SH	I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room.
SH	“I can’t make bricks without clay.”
SH	“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’
SH	cried the [NAME] of [NAME], when we had all three read this epistle.
SH	With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at [NAME], carrying the jewel with me.
SH	“‘Oh, very well.
SH	It was a singular sight which met our eyes.
SH	“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever.
SH	“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked.
SH	Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once.
SH	When he came to the high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
SH	“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
SH	And she was afterwards seen walking into [NAME] [NAME] in company with [NAME] [NAME], a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at [NAME] [NAME]’s house that morning.”
SH	I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on [NAME] morning.’
SH	“Very well, sir.
SH	[NAME] [NAME]_, of the singular adventures of the [NAME] [NAME] in the island of [NAME], and finally of the [NAME] poisoning case.
SH	It may well have been cause and effect.
SH	A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to [NAME], the modest residence of the great financier.
SH	‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now.
SH	“[NAME] help me!”
SH	Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”
SH	“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at [NAME]. 4.’
SH	You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”
SH	“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.”
SH	“Then we have stopped all the holes.
SH	I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder.
SH	I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy.
SH	I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following [NAME]’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.
SH	It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.
SH	“‘Yes, thief!’
SH	I have been cut to the quick.
SH	Let me introduce you to [NAME] [NAME], who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”
SH	I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’
SH	“Well, to come to an end of the matter, [NAME] [NAME], and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back.
SH	The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the [NAME] postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.
SH	You will first make a note, [NAME], of the paper and the date.”
SH	and I poured out some water from a [NAME].
SH	I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a small “[NAME]” woven into the texture of the paper.
SH	I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.
SH	“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.
SH	“Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _
SH	Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?”
SH	He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
SH	I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”
SH	“I am afraid so.
SH	Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
SH	It was after five o’clock when [NAME] [NAME] left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box.
SH	He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.
SH	“‘You cannot say what it was?’
SH	“So much for [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] when he had closed the door behind him.
SH	“Not [NAME]”  “It is half-past ten now.”
SH	Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above.
SH	Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“‘Look in here!’
SH	I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
SH	For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the [NAME] [NAME] government and of the better classes of the community in the [NAME].
SH	I am saved!”
SH	“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”
SH	“We shall see.”
SH	That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place.
SH	One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry ‘[NAME]!’
SH	I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little [NAME].
SH	He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
SH	“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.
SH	It will end in my being conveyed into the house.
SH	“Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked.
SH	“[NAME], [NAME], how are you?”
SH	The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
SH	[NAME] walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
SH	He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.
SH	If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping.
SH	The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see [NAME] as he lay upon the couch.
SH	“I hope we may clear him, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME].
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
SH	All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.
SH	“Then that will simplify matters.”
SH	“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
SH	It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
SH	And no more words were needed.
SH	Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before.
SH	“[NAME], no; the real name,” said [NAME] sweetly.
SH	“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said.
SH	It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little [NAME] white clouds drifting across from [NAME] to [NAME].
SH	“Frankly, then, [NAME], I do not.”
SH	It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles.
SH	“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,” replied [NAME] with some warmth.
SH	“Very, indeed.
SH	If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’
SH	“Ah, of course.
SH	I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.”
SH	We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
SH	The house was just such as I had pictured it from [NAME] [NAME]’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.
SH	On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table.
SH	“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”  “None.”
SH	As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.
SH	“I told you that I would call.”
SH	No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’
SH	“Your father,” said [NAME], “your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.”
SH	, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer.
SH	In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.
SH	“That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village.
SH	“Now, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”
SH	“Where to?”
SH	“‘Why that?’
SH	He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.
SH	At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means.
SH	His letters were to be forwarded to 226 [NAME] [NAME]; so [NAME] I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] in particular.
SH	I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in [NAME]’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.
SH	I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.
SH	It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side.
SH	There is not an instant to be lost.
SH	“It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”
SH	The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.
SH	And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young [NAME] to caution.
SH	Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears.
SH	I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
SH	“‘I am sure if I had known—’  “‘Well, then, you know now.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together.
SH	Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.’
SH	“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly.
SH	Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in [NAME].”
SH	“It is true.
SH	He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded [NAME] clergyman.
SH	[NAME] instantly gave the alarm, and [NAME] was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms.
SH	I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or [NAME].
SH	The table was set out ready for me, and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] was there to see that I got fairly to work.
SH	It is perhaps the best possible solution.
SH	The passage outside was empty.
SH	“It might have been difficult, but friend [NAME] held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know.
SH	“You see,” remarked [NAME], as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters.
SH	There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.
SH	“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.
SH	As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
SH	“It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
SH	Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”
SH	It could not be delirium.
SH	It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of [NAME] 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.”
SH	For answer [NAME] clapped the hat upon his head.
SH	“The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.
SH	“I shall see you at [NAME], then?”
SH	It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back.
SH	He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style.
SH	“Come in!” said [NAME].
SH	With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.
SH	This ring—” He slipped an [NAME] snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
SH	The ‘[NAME]!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with.
SH	People tell me that I have spoiled him.
SH	I cried, “this is a terrible injury.
SH	He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door.
SH	“‘Next [NAME] I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge.
SH	I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”
SH	“I see no marks.”
SH	Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading.
SH	He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
SH	“What will you say?”  “Give me a pencil and that slip of paper.
SH	“And have you any on hand just now?”
SH	But you see, [NAME], them’s not _our_ geese.”
SH	“But a cripple!” said [NAME]
SH	she cried; “I do so want a little help.”
SH	He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
SH	Does not that strike you?”
SH	“You are certainly joking, [NAME].”
SH	When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me.
SH	“The matter is too serious for any hesitation.
SH	Having taken the printed description.
SH	“[NAME] does.
SH	“I see it, I deduce it.
SH	Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to [NAME] [NAME] at once as a preliminary to starting for [NAME].”
SH	“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so.
SH	It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.”
SH	“Perhaps we may make them less so.”
SH	I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”
SH	“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion.
SH	“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about [NAME] and [NAME] and [NAME] and [NAME] and [NAME], and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the [NAME]’s before very long.
SH	“What do you read?”
SH	“Just one hint to you, [NAME],” drawled [NAME] before his rival vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter.
SH	There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.’”
SH	I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
SH	But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”
SH	“‘I am sure that I do not know.’
SH	He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown.
SH	They inherit [NAME] blood by direct descent, and [NAME] on the distaff side.
SH	“This is the envelope,” he continued.
SH	“The papers which [NAME] carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship.
SH	“It was a slight, [NAME], a public slight,” said [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], tapping his fingers upon the table.
SH	“I suppose,” said [NAME], “that when [NAME] [NAME] came back from [NAME] he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”
SH	I think myself that it is a page from some private diary.
SH	The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the [NAME] of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.
SH	Where does the thing come from?’
SH	“And what do you think of it all, [NAME]?” asked [NAME] [NAME], leaning back in his chair.
SH	“You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.”
SH	“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.
SH	What would he do then?
SH	“Quite so.
SH	“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he.
SH	He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me.
SH	Could you swear to it?”
SH	“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me.
SH	Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it.
SH	And now, [NAME], we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”
SH	As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”
SH	There would be one to Reading in less than an hour.
SH	“I fear not.”
SH	Take a pinch of snuff, [NAME], and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”
SH	She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions.
SH	“Do you know, [NAME],” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject.
SH	“Nothing?”  “To tell the [NAME] sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have felt helpless.
SH	I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
SH	They did not know how to look.”
SH	‘I have made my dark room up there.
SH	“‘I wish you, [NAME],’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will.
SH	She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.
SH	Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her?
SH	“After all, [NAME],” said [NAME], reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.
SH	“Certainly.”
SH	“And the murderer?”  “Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket.
SH	Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.
SH	He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.
SH	“You saw the ventilator, too?”
SH	In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”
SH	“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
SH	“Thank you.
SH	The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of “[NAME]!”
SH	I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.
SH	It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself.
SH	“Absolutely?”  “I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.”
SH	They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
SH	He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.
SH	I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the [NAME] and not very far from the [NAME] of [NAME].”
SH	“There is a little nut for you to crack, [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“Your French gold?”
SH	Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so.
SH	He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.”
SH	He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.
SH	“No, I don’t think you would guess.
SH	I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time.
SH	Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation.
SH	‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs.
SH	There is only one point on which I must insist.
SH	“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are without looking.”
SH	It has been considered artistic.
SH	Do not dream of going, [NAME], for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”
SH	‘If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’
SH	“Yes, from [NAME].”
SH	He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born [NAME] in the ship.
SH	“Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.”
SH	“Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a [NAME], that he has been in [NAME], and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”
SH	Hosmer—[NAME] [NAME]—was a cashier in an office in [NAME] [NAME]—and—”  “What office?”
SH	About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house.
SH	“I came to find a friend.”
SH	“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered [NAME] [NAME] with a sigh of relief.
SH	Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’
SH	Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young [NAME].
SH	He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named.
SH	Well, that is a list of my town suppliers.
SH	“It was [NAME] [NAME] who told me of it,” said he in a crackling voice.
SH	As he reached the corner of [NAME] [NAME], a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs.
SH	The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.
SH	“It is a murder, then?”
SH	She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.
SH	“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.
SH	Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
SH	“And your mother is alive?”
SH	And [NAME]’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose [NAME].
SH	When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but [NAME] would not hear of it.
SH	He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
SH	He opened the [NAME] bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
SH	6_d_., cocktail 1_s_.
SH	Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two.
SH	I was already a dying and a desperate man.
SH	“Stop it!”
SH	It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.
SH	“Then they carried me in.
SH	‘They will be here in a moment.
SH	He will be here in an hour.”
SH	“You don’t mind breaking the law?”
SH	“Pending the alterations, as I understand.
SH	“I begin to think, [NAME],” said [NAME], “that I make a mistake in explaining.
SH	A girl of fourteen, [NAME] [NAME], who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the [NAME] [NAME] estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.
SH	It’s the big white one over [NAME].
SH	“But who is he?”
SH	[NAME] looked startled.
SH	“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much.
SH	“It is his hat.”
SH	“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said [NAME].
SH	“There is but one thing to do.
SH	Now, look at that third name.
SH	Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.
SH	“A greater distance to travel.”
SH	I answered sharply.
SH	“I do not encourage visitors.”
SH	“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
SH	If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
SH	You see this other page in red ink?
SH	He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.
SH	They were evidently all deserted.
SH	Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.
SH	It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.
SH	“If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
SH	See what my wife found in its crop!”
SH	In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head.
SH	Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”
SH	Your life may depend upon your compliance.”
SH	“The newcomers were [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as [NAME] [NAME].
SH	It is all right.”
SH	Who are you?
SH	In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features.
SH	Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive.
SH	[NAME] was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of [NAME]’s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground.
SH	There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand.
SH	“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.
SH	They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire!
SH	He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son.
SH	A [NAME] or [NAME] could not have written that.
SH	‘I shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.
SH	The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long.
SH	He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”
SH	I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.”
SH	I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”
SH	If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”  “[NAME]!
SH	I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
SH	He has nerve and he has knowledge.
SH	But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place?
SH	“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room.
SH	Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves.
SH	Here is a pen.
SH	I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.
SH	She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.
SH	It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered.
SH	I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.
SH	“I hear that it was during the night, [NAME], but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] has been several times lately.
SH	“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time.
SH	I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME], upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown [NAME] up to the dressing-room of the [NAME] of [NAME] upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose.
SH	Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the [NAME] slavey.
SH	I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in [NAME] [NAME] once more.
SH	My sister thinks that I am going mad.
SH	“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”
SH	“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man.
SH	“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, [NAME] [NAME], which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.”
SH	We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him.
SH	His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there.
SH	He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society.
SH	I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five.
SH	But it is too heavy a task.
SH	“Now, then, [NAME],” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at?
SH	Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”
SH	She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the [NAME].
SH	“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked [NAME].
SH	“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised [NAME] [NAME] to be back before three.
SH	, while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about [NAME] [NAME], to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.”
SH	“It was only yesterday that the chance came.
SH	And here is the very note.”
SH	“Can I be of assistance?”
SH	“These are young [NAME]’s feet.
SH	We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed.
SH	Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house.
SH	“Well, and what happened when [NAME] [NAME], your stepfather, returned to [NAME]?”
SH	A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
SH	Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
SH	You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
SH	“[NAME] for a morning drive?”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but [NAME] [NAME] sprang forward and confronted him.
SH	“What shall I do?”
SH	The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
SH	I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us.
SH	“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!”
SH	“‘This is [NAME] [NAME] [NAME],’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the [NAME].’
SH	As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.
SH	Of these, one, the _[NAME] [NAME]_, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from [NAME], the name is that which is given to one of the states of the [NAME].”
SH	I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait.
SH	There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it.
SH	My mistress told me that you were likely to call.
SH	That is what [NAME] [NAME], of [NAME] [NAME], looks upon as so serious.
SH	I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too.
SH	His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion.
SH	“It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter.
SH	I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.
SH	“It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor [NAME] in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”
SH	She raised her dark eyebrows.
SH	“Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”
SH	“Here it is,” said he presently:  “‘Ku [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”
SH	The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.
SH	He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.
SH	“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.
SH	“I have them in the hollow of my hand.
SH	“Certainly.”
SH	They are all typewritten.
SH	“Very good.
SH	“You are right,” said [NAME] demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.”
SH	I cannot tell.
SH	“What do you make of that, [NAME]?”
SH	You must be weary, for you have had a long day.”
SH	It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
SH	This is only where we compress it.
SH	“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’
SH	“There’s nothing in it.
SH	“It looks newer than the other things?”
SH	Have you your cheque-book?
SH	There’s money in this case, [NAME], if there is nothing else.”
SH	Two days ago some repairs were started in the [NAME] wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.
SH	I have had nothing since breakfast.”
SH	The man hesitated for an instant.
SH	[NAME] traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.
SH	Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger.
SH	“[NAME]; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.
SH	For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.
SH	That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first.
SH	The inspector sat down at his desk.
SH	“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you.
SH	“Why, indeed?
SH	“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you.
SH	Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs.
SH	“But the money, [NAME] [NAME], the money!”
SH	“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
SH	I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.
SH	“I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed [NAME].”
SH	“You have an answer to everything.
SH	“‘You are mad, [NAME]!’
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] is a country district not very far from [NAME], in [NAME].
SH	He is one of the most dangerous men in [NAME]—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience.
SH	Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources.
SH	As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects.
SH	I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to [NAME] 88 [NAME]_.
SH	My niece, [NAME], has deserted me.”
SH	“‘And the work?’  “‘Is to copy out the _[NAME] [NAME]_.
SH	“He is still with you?”
SH	“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter.
SH	In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
SH	You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding.
SH	Your [NAME] has indeed committed an indiscretion.”
SH	[NAME] and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with [NAME] hurrying behind us.
SH	He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘[NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’ engraved upon it.
SH	he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the [NAME] [NAME] door banged, and from the window we could see [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] running at the top of his speed down the road.
SH	Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.
SH	“I say it is.”
SH	“You see it?”
SH	So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”
SH	“Oh, no, sir!
SH	Whom have I the honour to address?”
SH	“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of opinion.
SH	“What then?”
SH	Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it.
SH	Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
SH	“They are all seaports.
SH	“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other.
SH	“Well, it is a possible supposition.”
SH	“Never was such a fellow for photography.
SH	In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.
SH	There was nothing.
SH	There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.
SH	he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
SH	“I don’t believe it.”
SH	“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear [NAME],” he said cordially.
SH	The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open.
SH	“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered.
SH	But if you are found again, then all must come out.
SH	The marks are perfectly fresh.
SH	This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.”
SH	I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once.
SH	My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.
SH	I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw [NAME] out of the window at the other side of the road.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] wished [NAME] [NAME] to be so bound to [NAME] [NAME], and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.
SH	“Try the settee,” said [NAME], relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.
SH	I am much indebted to you, sir, for a [NAME] bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”
SH	“I think, [NAME], that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in [NAME].
SH	Where are the jewels which you have stolen?’
SH	Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset.
SH	I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the [NAME].
SH	That is very bad!
SH	“He is dead,” cried several voices.
SH	“By the select prices.
SH	“My name is [NAME] [NAME], and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest [NAME] families in [NAME], the [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME], on the western border of [NAME].”
SH	Passing down the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] we crossed over the river, and dashing up [NAME] [NAME] wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in [NAME] [NAME].
SH	You do not mean bodies?”
SH	“We shall be at the [NAME] Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and [NAME]
SH	“The right side?
SH	The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”
SH	Who is this [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and why does he pursue this unhappy family?”
SH	When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals.
SH	Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?”
SH	“And that is—”  “That [NAME] senior met his death from [NAME] junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”
SH	“Do not lose an instant.
SH	I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn.
SH	I had no idea that he was in front of me.
SH	“So much for the servants.
SH	“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said.
SH	We can’t command our love, but we can our actions.
SH	“It is no wonder that it did not wake you.
SH	Oh, [NAME], do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?
SH	She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”
SH	It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.
SH	My sister [NAME] and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother’s re-marriage.
SH	“That’s no good.”
SH	“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well.
SH	[NAME] [NAME], [NAME] division, gave evidence as to the arrest of [NAME], who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms.
SH	I had, as you know, cut off my hair in [NAME], and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk.
SH	THE [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME]  I had called upon my friend, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], one day in the  autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very  stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
SH	“[NAME] tell us what has happened to you.”
SH	what an observant young lady we have come upon.
SH	“I was only [NAME] [NAME] then.
SH	“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me.
SH	You may know the strict principles of her family.
SH	He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], was enough to draw him back again.
SH	“To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat.
SH	“This fellow [NAME] is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter.
SH	He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the [NAME] door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
SH	The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety.
SH	I have no time!
SH	I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”
SH	I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face.
SH	With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern.
SH	[NAME], or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality.
SH	And you know where they are.
SH	“It is not yet nine.
SH	He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.
SH	“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.”
SH	[NAME] never did it.
SH	“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard [NAME]’s remarks about the coronet.”
SH	Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him.
SH	“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.
SH	“And sit in the dark?”
SH	That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.
SH	“I am a practical man,” he said, “and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg.
SH	“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in.
SH	“It is always a joy to meet an [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the [NAME] [NAME] with the [NAME] and [NAME].”
SH	“Fine birds they were, too.
SH	I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.
SH	“He is still with you, I presume?”
SH	His smile broadened.
SH	By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”
SH	I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle.
SH	He wore rather baggy [NAME] [NAME]’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy [NAME] chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.
SH	Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further.
SH	“Pray take a seat,” said [NAME].
SH	“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world.
SH	Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing  yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no  inconvenience.
SH	The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with [NAME], when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Let us follow it out to the bitter end.
SH	When I see you, my dear [NAME], with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”
SH	“I think, [NAME], that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”
SH	On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at [NAME] [NAME], or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the [NAME].
SH	“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”
SH	Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage.
SH	This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in [NAME] and marry her at a registry office?
SH	He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight.
SH	[NAME] had one son, a lad of eighteen, and [NAME] had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.
SH	“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,’ said [NAME]
SH	Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”
SH	I may have to go down to [NAME], after all.”
SH	The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.
SH	“Quite so.”
SH	“This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.
SH	The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from [NAME], I felt that I was probably on the right track.
SH	And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco.
SH	The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.
SH	You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.”
SH	“[NAME], no, he found it.
SH	“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor.
SH	“What will the [NAME] say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”
SH	‘He has every requirement.
SH	“Here we are!” said [NAME] cheerily as we filed into the room.
SH	He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
SH	Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
SH	“You fill me with interest,” said [NAME].
SH	We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day.
SH	Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days.
SH	And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
SH	[NAME] was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by [NAME] [NAME].
SH	He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful.
SH	Then he closed the locket and handed it back to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“I see many objections to any such theory.”
SH	You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in.
SH	We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.
SH	“[NAME], the busybody!”
SH	I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of [NAME]’s words, and say, ‘There, but for the grace of [NAME], goes [NAME] [NAME].’”
SH	At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my [NAME]!
SH	The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
SH	I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the [NAME] to say that we have it.”
SH	Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of [NAME] for the lonely life of an English provincial town.
SH	But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects.
SH	“Remember, [NAME] that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence.
SH	I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to [NAME], where he lived, and take him into my confidence.
SH	“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered.
SH	But a human body is a different matter.
SH	For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.
SH	After all, I thought, we are not injuring her.
SH	“Pray continue,” said [NAME].
SH	“You see, [NAME] [NAME],” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man.
SH	I am but thirty now.”
SH	“‘From [NAME],’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.
SH	“Good heavens!”
SH	The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it.
SH	“Frequently.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him.
SH	I would call your attention very particularly to two points.
SH	If [NAME] were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse.
SH	A thick fog rolled down between the lines of [NAME]-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths.
SH	“‘[NAME] [NAME]?’ said he, with something of a German accent.
SH	His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself.
SH	“And on what day did he meet his death?”
SH	“I fished about with a rake.
SH	She was very independent in little matters like that.
SH	He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour.
SH	“Yes, that is the [NAME].”
SH	What has she been saying to you?”
SH	“This [NAME] [NAME] was evidently an important factor in the matter.
SH	We passed across [NAME], down [NAME] [NAME], and so through a zigzag of slums to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance.
SH	“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”
SH	I think that I must turn to you [NAME], for something more solid.”
SH	Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes.
SH	[NAME]_, and any others that occur to you.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient.
SH	I understand that you give me _[NAME] [NAME]_ to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”
SH	“Oh, a few minutes.
SH	“And how?”  “In the dress is a pocket.
SH	One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth.
SH	I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”
SH	from [NAME] for the purpose of consulting you.”
SH	And yet even here we may discriminate.
SH	“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’
SH	He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there.
SH	“On the contrary, this is the right side.”
SH	The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants.
SH	Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face.
SH	“I trust that I am not intruding.
SH	My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve.
SH	“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.
SH	[NAME] [NAME], who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter.
SH	With him we drove to the [NAME] [NAME] where a room had already been engaged for us.
SH	Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
SH	“You have been cruelly used,” said [NAME].
SH	And there is a little reward, I fancy.
SH	“How very absurd!
SH	“Did he not advertise?”  “No.”  “Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”  “Only as much as we can deduce.”
SH	“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed.
SH	He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.
SH	Where are the gems?”
SH	“And now you must on no account lose another instant.
SH	“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at [NAME] with his bright little eyes.
SH	“It was most suggestive,” said [NAME].
SH	It was obvious at a glance that the story of the [NAME]-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.
SH	“Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint?
SH	“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said [NAME] severely.
SH	Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade?
SH	This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
SH	Do not join in it.
SH	But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer.
SH	“In the bathroom,” he answered.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
SH	It is the more strange, since we know that [NAME] himself was averse to the idea.
SH	muttered [NAME], pulling at the rope.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it.
SH	“And how did you verify them?”
SH	We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which [NAME] had brought with him.
SH	Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
SH	“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.
SH	Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck.
SH	The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing [NAME] [NAME] pass he had seen his son, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], going the same way with a gun under his arm.
SH	“Oh, to the other side of the [NAME] End.
SH	If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] must be got off, however.”
SH	“‘Most admirably.’
SH	“What on earth can be the matter with him?”
SH	There is no good for you to do.’
SH	If we were to come to [NAME] [NAME] to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?”
SH	The man seemed surprised.
SH	“‘Why, what is it, then?’
SH	screamed the old man furiously.
SH	And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”
SH	A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed.
SH	While she was walking in this way down [NAME] [NAME], she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window.
SH	She is waiting now in the sitting-room.
SH	“Missing,” it said, “on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head.
SH	“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.
SH	We lunch at [NAME], and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.”
SH	“‘You understand, [NAME] [NAME], that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you.
SH	What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?”
SH	It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“‘Tell me, [NAME],’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?’
SH	But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.”
SH	Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.
SH	“Then that explains what the girl said.”
SH	Had she seen someone, then?
SH	“Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.”
SH	He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes.
SH	His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt.
SH	“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion imperturbably.
SH	“Well, I did what she said, [NAME] [NAME], and I carried the bird all the way to [NAME].
SH	“If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”
SH	He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.
SH	I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it.
SH	Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains.
SH	I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool.
SH	“How did that help you?”
SH	She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep.
SH	Here is the account:  “‘Between nine and ten last night [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME], of the [NAME] [NAME], on duty near [NAME] [NAME], heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.
SH	You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes under the full market price.
SH	It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.
SH	He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
SH	“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.
SH	The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.
SH	Another, [NAME] [NAME], the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months.
SH	I’ll serve you!”
SH	I shall be all anxiety.”
SH	“I say that I have solved it.”
SH	At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.
SH	By a curious chance you came upon her tresses.
SH	“I have solved it.”
SH	“Yes, that is it.”
SH	“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the inspector.
SH	He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his [NAME] confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
SH	The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had [NAME] [NAME] not been standing smiling on the door-step.
SH	“[NAME] fellow, that,” observed [NAME] as we walked away.
SH	Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand.
SH	It was a quarter past six when we left [NAME] [NAME], and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“He said too much.”
SH	“Last [NAME] I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me.
SH	“My dear [NAME],” said I, “this is too much.
SH	“Certainly, madam.”  “Do not trouble about my feelings.
SH	“They always fill me with a certain horror.
SH	“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.
SH	“You really are very fine indeed.
SH	‘You have been recommended to me, [NAME] [NAME], as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’
SH	“Then perhaps, [NAME] [NAME], you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.”
SH	What could it be, once more?
SH	“What is it?”
SH	“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked [NAME].
SH	The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
SH	“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots.
SH	I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured.
SH	She used to be at the [NAME].
SH	“Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked.
SH	“But you would not advise me to refuse?”
SH	“It was a singular document.
SH	‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes.
SH	[NAME] had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him.
SH	For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.
SH	“No.”  “It was clamped to the floor.
SH	I may want your help, and so may he.
SH	“[NAME] knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it.
SH	It was not merely that [NAME] changed his costume.
SH	I was preoccupied with business matters.’
SH	If not, why should you come to consult me?”
SH	[NAME] left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane.
SH	I was speaking only half an hour ago to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], who was a member of your goose club.”
SH	I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face.
SH	“Your [NAME] has something which I should value even more highly,” said [NAME].
SH	“‘Why, what did you think?’
SH	“You have given me fresh life and hope.
SH	I have been at work upon it all day.”
SH	He was an old friend of [NAME]’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him [NAME] [NAME] rent free.”
SH	“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw [NAME] here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying.
SH	“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”
SH	[NAME] shook his clenched hands in the air.
SH	I know that [NAME] didn’t do it.
SH	Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to [NAME]’ room.
SH	But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
SH	As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was.
SH	Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”
SH	“‘How far from the body?’  “‘A dozen yards or so.’
SH	I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.
SH	The [NAME] [NAME]_, “it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.
SH	“All is lost.”
SH	I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?”
SH	The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived.
SH	As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.
SH	With your permission, [NAME] [NAME], I shall now continue my investigations outside.”
SH	“You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”
SH	“And what did you do then?” asked [NAME].
SH	‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.’
SH	Better make it out for [NAME] 4000.”
SH	“My dear [NAME], you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents.
SH	One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
SH	“What are you going to do, then?”
SH	“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down.
SH	He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of [NAME] satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water.
SH	“And why in hopes?”  “Because it would spare your [NAME] all fear of future annoyance.
SH	“I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away.
SH	Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”
SH	“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the [NAME] was at the foot of the stairs.”  “Quite so.
SH	It must be where she can lay her hands upon it.
SH	You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell [NAME] [NAME]’s cigar.
SH	“But not more so than I to find you.”
SH	“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, [NAME] [NAME], and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
SH	“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth.
SH	“My dear [NAME]!”
SH	“How about poison?”  “The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”
SH	“You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition.
SH	Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.
SH	The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
SH	You may go to any expense which you think necessary.
SH	“‘There are three missing.
SH	“Yes, it was twisted.”
SH	This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”
SH	“You did it very nicely, [NAME],” he remarked.
SH	“This is indeed important,” said he.
SH	“[NAME],” I cried, “you are too late.”
SH	“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.
SH	By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.”
SH	The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
SH	There is a strong presumption that the person whom [NAME] expected to meet him at [NAME] [NAME] was someone who had been in [NAME].”
SH	“Thank you.
SH	“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me.
SH	he cried, grasping [NAME] [NAME] by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
SH	“What have you done?” asked [NAME].
SH	“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he.
SH	It’s not been fed for two days.
SH	Well, [NAME], we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this [NAME] [NAME] to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.
SH	His silence appears to me to cut both ways.
SH	“Yes, the wine-cellar.”
SH	There can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship.
SH	‘You will be the ruin of us.
SH	“And perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
SH	Ah, [NAME], you have just come at the right time.
SH	[NAME] [NAME], a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case.
SH	It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful [NAME] [NAME], and over the broad gleaming [NAME], found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of [NAME].
SH	“All right,” said [NAME] with a stare and a snigger.
SH	Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
SH	It is in a German-speaking country—in [NAME], not far from [NAME].
SH	It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”
SH	“Did you become engaged then?”
SH	“I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”
SH	I called in the inspector and gave him into custody.
SH	“She told me to ask you.”
SH	You have been looking a little pale lately.
SH	As it is an open secret that the [NAME] of [NAME] has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] has no property of his own save the small estate of [NAME], it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”
SH	Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views.
SH	Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
SH	“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’
SH	Well, [NAME], we shall see who will win in the long run.
SH	What could be the reason of his overpowering terror?
SH	On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
SH	“We have tried and failed.”
SH	It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at [NAME], where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”
SH	You bring [NAME] [NAME] here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it?
SH	You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”
SH	“And it is—”  “That [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested.
SH	We had reached [NAME] [NAME] and had stopped at the door.
SH	‘I could not bear the disgrace.
SH	“But how?”  “Through the skylight.
SH	His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking.
SH	“That will do very nicely.
SH	He had, as it appears, been returning from [NAME] in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’
SH	“I hardly think that likely.
SH	“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”
SH	“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.
SH	And this stone?”
SH	But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”
SH	Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”
SH	“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered.
SH	“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration.
SH	The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated.
SH	“Thank you,” said [NAME], “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the [NAME].”
SH	“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better.
SH	“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already.
SH	“I suppose you know all about it,” he snarled.
SH	“We’ll call a cab and go together.
SH	Every good stone is.
SH	“My own seal.”
SH	Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
SH	Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven.
SH	“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it.
SH	“My stepfather’s business papers.”
SH	“None.”  “No legal papers or certificates?”  “None.”
SH	“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young [NAME]’s.”
SH	As far as I can make out, the [NAME] was founded by an American millionaire, [NAME] [NAME], who was very peculiar in his ways.
SH	On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to [NAME] gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman.
SH	“I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, [NAME] [NAME],” he said.
SH	“It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
SH	It was, indeed, our friend the financier.
SH	“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”
SH	“The band!
SH	Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product.
SH	“You can easily imagine, [NAME] [NAME], how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be.
SH	He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
SH	He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
SH	“I will get her to show me.”
SH	How did your mother take the matter?”
SH	“Won’t it ring?”
SH	“But to whom?”  “To an English lawyer named [NAME].”
SH	“From [NAME] [NAME] to the [NAME] [NAME] is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground.
SH	“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.
SH	“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more.
SH	We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den.
SH	“Well, [NAME] [NAME], if your mind is made up, that settles the question,” said [NAME], smiling.
SH	He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock.
SH	The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady?
SH	‘Tell [NAME] that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to [NAME], the [NAME] lawyer.’
SH	As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.”
SH	The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.
SH	I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.
SH	Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst.
SH	said [NAME] sternly.
SH	“You would not think [NAME] 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”
SH	Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?”
SH	This case, I presume, contains the coronet.
SH	“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket.
SH	“[NAME], I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done.
SH	We are at present, [NAME]—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the [NAME] branch of one of the principal [NAME] banks.
SH	This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.
SH	The culprit is—”  “[NAME] [NAME] [NAME],” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
SH	It’s hard to say his age.
SH	“None at all,” said [NAME].
SH	“It missed him, then?”
SH	As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best.
SH	In the scuffle, your son struck [NAME] [NAME] and cut him over the eye.
SH	I may tell you that, besides [NAME] [NAME], both [NAME] and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door.
SH	I would not have missed it for worlds.
SH	She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.
SH	“If I tell her she will not believe me.
SH	I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”
SH	“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”
SH	What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?”
SH	“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, [NAME] [NAME].
SH	A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity.
SH	It is so dreadful to think of our dear [NAME] in prison!”
SH	“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
SH	she asked.
SH	“Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”
SH	I deserve to be kicked from here to [NAME] [NAME].
SH	Was it to be in church?”
SH	Something like fear sprang up in the [NAME] [NAME]’s expressive black eyes.
SH	I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries.
SH	“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the salesman.
SH	Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”
SH	The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.
SH	Have just been wired for from the west of [NAME] in connection with [NAME] [NAME] tragedy.
SH	“Have you dragged the basin of [NAME] [NAME] fountain?” he asked.
SH	“No; we don’t keep a cat.
SH	One of the largest stalls bore the name of [NAME] upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.
SH	“Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and [NAME], the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
SH	“I cannot as yet see any connection.”
SH	He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.
SH	“I am still in the dark.”
SH	Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME] back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path.
SH	“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” [NAME] answered.
SH	“You will not go there first?”
SH	“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good.
SH	“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?”
SH	By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children.
SH	But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed.
SH	Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him.
SH	“I cannot imagine.”
SH	This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the [NAME] [NAME], and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in [NAME], [NAME], the [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME].
SH	It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place.
SH	“You have done wisely,” said my friend.
SH	“But, surely, it was obvious.
SH	Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.
SH	Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.”
SH	“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help.
SH	“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers.
SH	I had no keener pleasure than in following [NAME] in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.
SH	THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER [NAME]  “To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked [NAME] [NAME], tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _
SH	I never will again.
SH	There’s no vice in him.”
SH	As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”
SH	I felt, however, that when [NAME] was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence.
SH	“Thank you.
SH	“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young [NAME]’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him.
SH	As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it.
SH	“Oh, no, no!
SH	But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’
SH	“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.
SH	You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.”
SH	On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth.
SH	“Why, I have lost four pound a week.”
SH	“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest.
SH	“Precisely so.
SH	“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”
SH	“No, finished.”
SH	“He slept on the premises.”
SH	‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.
SH	Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”
SH	“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black [NAME] case which he had laid beside his chair.
SH	He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear.
SH	Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.”
SH	“No, I had a dozen.”
SH	I hardly looked at his face.
SH	“On the contrary,” said [NAME] quietly; “I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose.
SH	It was nearly one o’clock when [NAME] [NAME] returned from his excursion.
SH	“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered [NAME] thoughtfully.
SH	She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”
SH	And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all?
SH	“I went home to [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME], and I took the advice of my assistant.
SH	It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.
SH	“And now, [NAME] [NAME], off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.
SH	She rose at once.
SH	Having left [NAME] at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table.
SH	She is even more affected than [NAME]”  “You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”
SH	“‘Precisely so.
SH	‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of [NAME], and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’
SH	But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.
SH	“Very murderous indeed.”
SH	And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.’
SH	[NAME] rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him.
SH	“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”
SH	It is a hat of the very best quality.
SH	“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters.
SH	“Was he the only applicant?”
SH	“He brought round both hat and goose to me on [NAME] morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
SH	I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning.
SH	There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them [NAME] [NAME], the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained [NAME], whom you may recollect in connection with the [NAME] in [NAME], to work out the case in his interest.
SH	“I have no data yet.
SH	“No, distinctly professional.”
SH	He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.
SH	“Incredible imbecility!”
SH	I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.
SH	It is a little place near the borders of [NAME], and within seven miles of [NAME].
SH	I have already offered a reward of [NAME] 1000.
SH	He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.
SH	“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly.
SH	Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged.
SH	In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.
SH	“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
SH	He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”
SH	“Let us have everything in its due order.”
SH	There was but one way for it.
SH	Sometimes [NAME] would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow.
SH	“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”
SH	“My dear fellow, there lies the problem.
SH	“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there.
SH	asked this apparition.
SH	“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
SH	He was a devil incarnate.
SH	That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father.
SH	What a time it seemed!
SH	“You forget that I know nothing about it.”
SH	Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
SH	“That’s the worst of it, [NAME] [NAME], I don’t know.”
SH	When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love.
SH	But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.
SH	“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
SH	“But of what society?”  “Have you never—” said [NAME] [NAME], bending forward and sinking his
SH	“In answer to an advertisement.”
SH	The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough.
SH	“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed [NAME] thoughtfully.
SH	“You have given orders that [NAME] should be liberated, have you not, [NAME]?”
SH	“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”
SH	“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!
SH	[NAME] help me!
SH	[NAME] [NAME] of [NAME] was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“This photograph!”
SH	“If your [NAME] would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I should be better able to advise you.”
SH	“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it.
SH	[NAME] rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.
SH	“Well, yes.
SH	Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth.
SH	I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”
SH	“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of [NAME].
SH	“I will do it.”
SH	He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.”
SH	I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into [NAME] this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.
SH	And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably.
SH	I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.
SH	“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.”
SH	“‘And be laughed at for my pains.
SH	“Yes, have you not heard?
SH	For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.
SH	In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past.
SH	The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon.
SH	It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves.
SH	To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”
SH	I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches.
SH	“‘Then the matter stands thus.
SH	“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in [NAME].
SH	For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’
SH	If they had come from [NAME] in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
SH	The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose.
SH	“The game’s up, [NAME],” said [NAME] quietly.
SH	“Very strange!”
SH	“I should like to see him very much.”
SH	Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.
SH	“It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
SH	“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the [NAME] of the Red-headed Men.
SH	I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear.
SH	I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.”
SH	The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”
SH	you thief!
SH	He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
SH	“Here you are, ‘[NAME] [NAME], 117, [NAME] [NAME], egg and poultry supplier.’”
SH	I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket.
SH	Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.
SH	“Five attempts have been made.
SH	“‘May I ask where you live, [NAME]?’ said [NAME]  “‘[NAME].
SH	“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, [NAME]!
SH	“Then let us do so.
SH	The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as [NAME] clutched at his skirts.
SH	I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair.
SH	“‘[NAME], sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.
SH	“I was also aware of that,” murmured [NAME], settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
SH	“And [NAME]”  “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.
SH	Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of [NAME] and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.
SH	One is to a firm in the [NAME], the other is to the [NAME] [NAME]’s stepfather, [NAME] [NAME], asking him whether he could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening.
SH	We have already a clue.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] raved in the air.
SH	These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
SH	What have we here?
SH	“‘And the work?’  “‘Is purely nominal.’
SH	“Certainly.”
SH	She was bound to have me in.
SH	“Not in the least.”
SH	But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent?
SH	“I say, [NAME], what o’clock is it?”
SH	“But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.”
SH	You have heard something, [NAME] [NAME]; you have learned something!
SH	She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
SH	“Subtle enough and horrible enough.
SH	And, first of all, we must choose our positions.
SH	“And what then?”  “You must leave that to me.
SH	Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’
SH	I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”
SH	“An accident, I presume?”
SH	“Yes, only one.”
SH	To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.
SH	“Why, indeed?” murmured [NAME].
SH	We must be at [NAME] [NAME] to meet her.”
SH	“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances.
SH	“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”
SH	“It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.
SH	Was there a police-station anywhere near?
SH	“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s.
SH	And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer.
SH	“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’
SH	“Never to return.”
SH	I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it.
SH	“I was afraid that you were engaged.”
SH	“I will go when I have had my say.
SH	She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath.
SH	He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition.
SH	The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
SH	A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”
SH	A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me.
SH	“Then, come.
SH	I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.”
SH	A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.
SH	I traced her!
SH	“It is always awkward doing business with an alias.”
SH	“And why did you wish to see me?”
SH	But you shall have it all just as it occurred.
SH	See that light among the trees?
SH	“It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.”
SH	“I think that it is very probable.”
SH	“[NAME]!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], before you go to the official police.”
SH	“And now, [NAME], perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”
SH	But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.”
SH	“The postmark is [NAME]—eastern division.
SH	It is terror.”
SH	“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then.
SH	It is this infernal [NAME] [NAME] marriage case.
SH	On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare.
SH	He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.
SH	“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out.
SH	You said it should not be again.
SH	You have dishonoured me forever!
SH	Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers.
SH	In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”
SH	I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”
SH	“Well, [NAME],” said [NAME] when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?”
SH	You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.
SH	He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand.
SH	“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”
SH	Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’
SH	Singularity is almost invariably a clue.
SH	As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.
SH	[NAME] walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
SH	The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force.
SH	I will call at four o’clock in the  afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,  I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount  importance.
SH	That sounded ominous.
SH	“She will not be able to.
SH	“Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.
SH	I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here.
SH	He has been a disappointment to me, [NAME] [NAME]—a grievous disappointment.
SH	There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter.
SH	she asked.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
SH	“They would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him.
SH	“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—[NAME]’s bird, we call it.
SH	I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo.
SH	“We have retained these things for some days,” said [NAME], “because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address.
SH	Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”
SH	“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he.
SH	“Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?
SH	6_d_., [NAME] sherry, 8_d_.’
SH	“[NAME], sir.
SH	Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark.
SH	There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life.
SH	My gross takings amount to [NAME] 27 10_s_.
SH	“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour.
SH	Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat.
SH	But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
SH	“It is possible.”
SH	But the maiden herself was most instructive.”
SH	There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else.
SH	“My eye caught the name of [NAME], and the heading ‘[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].’
SH	He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.
SH	“For [NAME]’s sake, have mercy!”
SH	She is four-and-twenty.”
SH	You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME], maid to the [NAME], deposed to having heard [NAME]’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness.
SH	“There is some building going on there,” said [NAME]; “that is where we are going.”
SH	“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said [NAME]  “‘Oh, never mind about that, [NAME] [NAME]!’ said [NAME] [NAME].
SH	“‘What then?’
SH	“She was never happy at home, [NAME] [NAME] wasn’t, from the time that her father married again.
SH	Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
SH	Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since.
SH	“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
SH	On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me.
SH	How cruelly I have misjudged him!”
SH	And, I say, [NAME], just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.”
SH	If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”
SH	It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
SH	“At the wedding breakfast.”
SH	There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.
SH	I’ve had one or two little turns also with [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession.
SH	[NAME] would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
SH	It was only to-day that I spoke to Major [NAME] about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”
SH	She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
SH	I swear it.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
SH	“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear [NAME], how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data.
SH	“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain.
SH	Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.”
SH	“Is [NAME] still drunk?” he asked.
SH	“Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.”
SH	As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.
SH	As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools.
SH	“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.
SH	“There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he remarked, “so I think, [NAME], that I must leave you to your papers for a little.”
SH	“And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way.
SH	How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”
SH	I hope that I make it all plain?’
SH	‘I perceive that all is as it should be.
SH	“I took it up and examined it.
SH	And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
SH	“I only wish that you could come with me, [NAME], but I fear that it won’t do.
SH	Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress.
SH	He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
SH	“And pray what am I charged with?”
SH	This is my point.”
SH	It is the five miles of country which makes the danger.
SH	“One day—it was in [NAME], 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate.
SH	I shall write to [NAME] [NAME] at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for [NAME] to-morrow.”
SH	I think, [NAME], that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.”
SH	One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.
SH	“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”
SH	Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul.
SH	The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.”
SH	A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger.
SH	I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.
SH	Both could be saved if I could but silence that [NAME] tongue.
SH	You have really done very well indeed.
SH	I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.
SH	“What, then?”
SH	It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at [NAME], of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.
SH	“It is both, or none,” said he.
SH	“But you have hopes?”
SH	I asked when I had finished.
SH	My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.
SH	I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while [NAME]-[NAME] had waited a little, and then had gone away.
SH	How very impertinent!
SH	However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”
SH	You have come up from the south-[NAME], I see.”
SH	Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember.
SH	It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’
SH	[NAME] laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat.
SH	[NAME] remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.
SH	We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands.
SH	The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.
SH	Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”
SH	“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?”
SH	“Of course!
SH	If I could only bring you down all would be well.
SH	[NAME] [NAME]’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
SH	They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.
SH	Some little distance down [NAME] [NAME], upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall.
SH	Then the charge against him will break down.”
SH	It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour.
SH	Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”
SH	He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity.
SH	Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.
SH	“‘Come! come!’
SH	“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], of [NAME], in the county of [NAME].”
SH	Then I thought of the whistle.
SH	It might be a satisfaction to his [NAME] to regain it with his own hands.”
SH	“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood.
SH	“Just see how it glints and sparkles.
SH	“But I have heard all that you have heard.”
SH	“Oh, indeed!
SH	But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the [NAME]’s.”
SH	“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side.
SH	“I am going right on.”
SH	“A call for help, you thought?”
SH	Are you satisfied?”
SH	“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell.
SH	I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out.
SH	I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’
SH	“Nothing to complain of, [NAME].
SH	“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”
SH	“It was all-important.
SH	“One more question.
SH	When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.
SH	“Someone has loosed the dog.
SH	“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
SH	I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me.
SH	“Nothing.”
SH	“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”
SH	The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
SH	She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom.
SH	He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room.
SH	The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read [NAME] [NAME]’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects.
SH	Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.
SH	I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter [NAME] three times repeated.
SH	“Last week he hurled the local [NAME] over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure.
SH	“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.’
SH	My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.
SH	[NAME] that point.
SH	With a dazed face the banker made out the required check.
SH	If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy.
SH	The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of [NAME] 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than [NAME] 750.
SH	Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”
SH	Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much.
SH	The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.
SH	“Pray take the basket-chair.
SH	I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock.
SH	“Have you managed it?” asked [NAME].
SH	But my memory and my girl!
SH	“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that [NAME] [NAME] was not alone.
SH	He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us.
SH	Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it.
SH	The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes.
SH	I know that all is well with him.
SH	A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.
SH	I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
SH	It is all dark to me.”
SH	I was young.
SH	“And why?”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little [NAME]’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the fascinating daughter of a [NAME] millionaire.
SH	Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it.
SH	“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”
SH	I hope that I have made myself clear?”
SH	“Well, at least,” said [NAME], “you have had your revenge upon them.
SH	“I was staggered, [NAME].
SH	She never came back.”
SH	I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.
SH	It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.
SH	“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
SH	It is cabinet size.
SH	“‘Not at all.
SH	“And your father?
SH	He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table.
SH	“I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them.
SH	I see the direction in which all this points.
SH	“What, then, did [NAME] do?”
SH	He waved his hands.”
SH	Then there are successive entries that A and [NAME] cleared, or left the country, and finally that [NAME] was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for [NAME] [NAME], I think, [NAME], that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young [NAME] has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.
SH	I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’
SH	Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
SH	“Witness: I must still refuse.
SH	“He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am.
SH	[NAME] and his father had many disagreements about me.
SH	The lady, I think, you have already met.”
SH	“Was the photograph a cabinet?”
SH	He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
SH	I think it was before your time, [NAME].
SH	Your salary with me, [NAME], would commence at [NAME] 100 a year.’
SH	“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—”
SH	Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.
SH	I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach.
SH	‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again.
SH	They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”
SH	As to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], my friend [NAME], rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at [NAME], where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
SH	I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women.
SH	[NAME] shot an angry glance at my companion.
SH	“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part.
SH	The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there.
SH	I have traced her.
SH	My stepdaughter has been here.
SH	You say so!
SH	There was nothing else save the five dried pips.
SH	“[NAME]!” said [NAME], looking keenly at her.
SH	“I had a friend once called [NAME], who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in [NAME].
SH	“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the [NAME] End called [NAME]’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.
SH	Now turn that up in the ledger.”
SH	“It was from the reigning family of [NAME], though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”
SH	What could that something be?
SH	“Where, then, is my wife?”
SH	Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once.
SH	Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the [NAME] [NAME], so that there is really no tie between them.
SH	“I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”
SH	“No, I shall commence with the [NAME].
SH	At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.
SH	“Now, [NAME],” said [NAME], as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns.
SH	“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
SH	“‘Oh, tut, [NAME]!
SH	We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.
SH	I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.”
SH	“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”
SH	He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] gave a violent start and dropped his gloves.
SH	His orders were to stay in the house.”
SH	Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.
SH	However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter.
SH	My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.
SH	Good-day, [NAME] [NAME], and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.”
SH	“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”
SH	“They must have done so.
SH	What do you deduce from it?”
SH	“If you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all.
SH	It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do.
SH	Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.
SH	Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
SH	‘Which is it you want, then?’
SH	There was a parallel instance in [NAME] some years back, and something on very much the same lines at [NAME] the year after the [NAME]-[NAME] [NAME].
SH	“Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready.
SH	[NAME] had been a prisoner among the [NAME], had escaped, came on to ’[NAME], found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to [NAME], followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”
SH	“Then you may be so with me.”
SH	“Precisely so.
SH	“‘It is your only chance,’ said she.
SH	Now where did you get them from?”
SH	“Who are you, then?
SH	“It’s all clear,” he whispered.
SH	She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out.
SH	But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between [NAME].
SH	“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, [NAME]?’ says she.
SH	“What _can_ be the matter, then?
SH	As to [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming.
SH	The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived.
SH	There is not, and there never has been, any such person.”
SH	So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators.
SH	What is he like, this [NAME] [NAME]?”  “Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty.
SH	[NAME] scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.
SH	“Anything else?” asked [NAME], yawning.
SH	Might I beg that you will break it off.”
SH	It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.
SH	“And they were posted to-day at [NAME].
SH	But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
SH	I know that she will do it.
SH	We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”
SH	By degrees [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.
SH	She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
SH	I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart.
SH	“You are hungry,” I remarked.
SH	I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’ cases.”
SH	But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”
SH	There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been.
SH	“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity.
SH	‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’
SH	You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains.
SH	We were engaged to each other, [NAME] and I; but then one day [NAME] struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor [NAME] here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing.
SH	“One of his hands.”  “One?”  “His hand when he wrote hurriedly.
SH	I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”
SH	“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire.
SH	Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.
SH	My wife is very anxious that you should  come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you.
SH	Sit down in that armchair, [NAME], and give us your best attention.”
SH	Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”
SH	You may remember the old [NAME] saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’
SH	“But his lameness?”
SH	But our trap should be here.”
SH	The speckled band!’
SH	“Not particularly.”
SH	I hope that I may be back in a few hours.”
SH	“Well, [NAME] [NAME], when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing.
SH	“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.
SH	Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it.
SH	Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
SH	When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits.
SH	She heard [NAME] [NAME] the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father.
SH	Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
SH	Now, [NAME], put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”
SH	The ring, after all, proves nothing.
SH	“And how in the world did you find them?”
SH	Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely.
SH	Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of [NAME] [NAME], we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
SH	“But I am all in the dark.”
SH	It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”
SH	The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.
SH	[NAME] lock to the door.
SH	Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.
SH	It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.
SH	But how on earth—”  “Oh, tut, tut!
SH	My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.
SH	“It was in [NAME], ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then.
SH	“I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this [NAME] bag.
SH	“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.
SH	Some woman came talking something or other about [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook [NAME].
SH	“But [NAME] [NAME] being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.”
SH	If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”
SH	“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman.
SH	About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly.
SH	To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him.
SH	It was the bisulphate of baryta.”
SH	“[NAME] bless you!
SH	He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness.
SH	Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.”
SH	“Why serious?”
SH	We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”
SH	“‘Ten to two.’
SH	“[NAME], I think.”
SH	“Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”
SH	“This is a very deep business,” he said at last.
SH	You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the [NAME].
SH	I went to my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.
SH	“‘Quite sure, [NAME].’  “‘Then, good-night.’
SH	this may save us a visit to [NAME] [NAME],” whispered [NAME].
SH	On the inside of the flap he wrote “[NAME] [NAME] for [NAME] [NAME]”
SH	It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
SH	It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort.
SH	I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness.
SH	For answer [NAME] pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee.
SH	“I think that we may safely say,” returned [NAME], “that she is wherever [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] is.
SH	I could not live there longer without some advice.
SH	On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones.
SH	It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the [NAME] murder and the [NAME] treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.”
SH	“A day which has saved [NAME] from a great public scandal,” said the banker, rising.
SH	“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.’
SH	I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.
SH	“‘Which dealer’s?’  “‘[NAME], of [NAME] [NAME].’
SH	“‘And not a word to a soul.’
SH	Do you understand?”
SH	The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.
SH	When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.
SH	He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat.
SH	“Not social, then?”
SH	‘_[NAME] [NAME] pro [NAME]_,’ you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.
SH	The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the [NAME] [NAME]’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come.
SH	They are not very exacting, after all.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] shall not long remain unavenged.
SH	[NAME] turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.
SH	Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting.
SH	“Why, you are like a magician,” said she.
SH	Born in 1846.’
SH	If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country.
SH	“I called about that beggarman, [NAME]—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], of [NAME].”
SH	Then you think that the [NAME] plays no part in the matter?”
SH	“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.
SH	“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man [NAME]; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.
SH	You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair.
SH	Can you remember any other little things about [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]?”
SH	He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard.
SH	She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
SH	Ah, [NAME], it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”
SH	It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.
SH	“Well, really!”
SH	It’s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.
SH	“Really, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME] as we followed them from the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
SH	Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it.
SH	“Here it is!”
SH	“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance.
SH	Who could come to-night?
SH	“I am in hopes that she does.”
SH	Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
SH	“It is, I think, much more likely that [NAME] [NAME] is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold.
SH	“Upon what point?”  “In your heart of hearts, do you think that [NAME] is alive?”
SH	I have not come to stay,” said [NAME] “There is a friend of mine here, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and I wish to speak with him.”
SH	In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’
SH	It was something terrible and deadly.
SH	He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there.
SH	“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.
SH	“What of this ‘[NAME]!’
SH	My marriage had drifted us away from each other.
SH	Can you suggest no explanation?”
SH	But he is a dirty scoundrel.”
SH	But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?”
SH	Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.
SH	Twice she has been waylaid.
SH	I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of [NAME] [NAME], who was waiting outside.
SH	It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise.
SH	she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “I am so glad that you have come.
SH	“We were both in the photograph.”
SH	I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
SH	We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are.
SH	“[NAME], [NAME]?” he asked.
SH	Here is the first heading upon which I come.
SH	I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear.
SH	My mind was soon made up.
SH	I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.
SH	He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.
SH	“Evidently,” said I, “[NAME] [NAME]’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed [NAME].
SH	My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”
SH	“My opinion is in no way altered.”
SH	“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace.
SH	“And is that all?”
SH	[NAME] had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the [NAME] border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery.
SH	We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered [NAME] to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain.
SH	After an hour or so, [NAME] [NAME] suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little [NAME] in the nursery.
SH	I went down to the [NAME] [NAME] and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, [NAME] bound to [NAME].
SH	Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig.
SH	“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any longer.
SH	“On your arm?”  “No, alone.
SH	“Coarse writing,” murmured [NAME].
SH	“What then?”  “The knees of his trousers.”
SH	Perhaps, [NAME] [NAME], you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative.
SH	“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.”
SH	In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”
SH	“You may imagine, [NAME] [NAME], that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true.
SH	Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”
SH	I heard from [NAME] [NAME] how you saved him in the [NAME] [NAME] scandal.”
SH	I imagine that you saw all that I did.”
SH	The photograph was of [NAME] [NAME] herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to “[NAME] [NAME], [NAME].
SH	“My private note-paper.”  “[NAME].”
SH	“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, [NAME] [NAME],” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”
SH	When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
SH	There is a comfortable sofa.
SH	“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.”
SH	I can do nothing for myself.”
SH	Who would have believed it?
SH	“How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.
SH	“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, [NAME] [NAME], had anything to do with the matter?”
SH	“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks.
SH	We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to [NAME] without being suspected.
SH	I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid.
SH	“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man.
SH	It is precisely for that reason that we are going to [NAME] [NAME] this day.
SH	I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this.
SH	“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she.
SH	These little problems help me to do so.”
SH	I had something else to think of.”
SH	“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.
SH	“It surprised me.”
SH	[NAME] [NAME] sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of [NAME] [NAME]’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves.
SH	“I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.”
SH	I know the military neatness which characterises you.
SH	[NAME] showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man.
SH	“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one.
SH	“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe.
SH	“Very naturally.
SH	“[NAME] help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father.
SH	“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.
SH	“‘[NAME] 4th, rooms [NAME]_., breakfast 2_s_.
SH	“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’
SH	You have formed some conclusion?
SH	Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.
SH	“Perhaps I have.”
SH	I know him from the photograph.”
SH	“Did you observe the colour?”
SH	Besides, she is not so very young.
SH	We are spies in an enemy’s country.
SH	“In what way?” asked [NAME].
SH	He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.
SH	In life or in death, I am ever  your loving,  “‘[NAME].’
SH	“But he must be alive, [NAME] [NAME].”
SH	He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
SH	Three thousand will cover the matter.
SH	You may set your mind at rest about that.
SH	“I can quite understand your thinking so,” I said.
SH	A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.
SH	“It is a noiseless lock,” said he.
SH	“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.
SH	At the moment when [NAME] struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.
SH	“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy.
SH	But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall.
SH	She told him of the coronet.
SH	Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the [NAME] of [NAME] and of the [NAME] [NAME] photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the [NAME] of [NAME], and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the [NAME] in [NAME], I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
SH	We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an [NAME] from [NAME] with a grey cloak.”
SH	“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’
SH	He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands.
SH	Here you are, [NAME], run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.”
SH	We shall then look thoroughly into the affair.
SH	It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	He beckoned to me and then began walking into the [NAME].
SH	“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said [NAME].
SH	“You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,” he said.
SH	That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to [NAME] to-night.
SH	I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”
SH	He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table.
SH	“Not a bit, [NAME].
SH	“We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”
SH	“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings.
SH	You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were.
SH	The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.”
SH	She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, [NAME] [NAME] and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel.
SH	“It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
SH	This year our good host, [NAME] by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at [NAME].
SH	It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.
SH	I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of [NAME].”
SH	“The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] at the other.
SH	“Never better.
SH	That is obvious.
SH	Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little?
SH	But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?”
SH	“I think you will find,” said [NAME] [NAME], “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting.
SH	[NAME] pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
SH	From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”
SH	THE ADVENTURE OF THE [NAME] [NAME]  “[NAME],” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, “here is a madman coming along.
SH	There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still.
SH	As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.
SH	I wish to the [NAME] that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.
SH	It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
SH	I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success.
SH	The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes.
SH	It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.
SH	“That is easily got.”
SH	I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.
SH	That will just show you how fond he was of me, [NAME] [NAME], and the little things that he would think of.”
SH	He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.
SH	“Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home.
SH	“‘I shall certainly be there.’
SH	“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’
SH	I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece.
SH	“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in [NAME], and had always been his friend.
SH	A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.
SH	As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.
SH	[NAME] looked sadly at my companion.
SH	“‘Dear me!
SH	In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.
SH	The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.
SH	I whispered; “did you see it?”
SH	All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of [NAME] the [NAME]-hound, [NAME] the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.
SH	“I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning.
SH	“He seems a very amiable person,” said [NAME], laughing.
SH	“‘Then, good-bye, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’
SH	“I cannot think.”
SH	“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”
SH	He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local [NAME] paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred.
SH	The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.
SH	That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor.
SH	“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was  really an object of interest to the celebrated [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
SH	I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.
SH	He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers.
SH	“[NAME] [NAME]’s address you never had, I understand.
SH	Here is the note written in pencil over here.”
SH	There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.
SH	Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’
SH	With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.
SH	said [NAME], laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more.
SH	“That hurts my pride, [NAME],” he said at last.
SH	“What I expected to see.”
SH	It ran in this way:  “[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at [NAME], and had only just returned upon the morning of last [NAME], the 3rd.
SH	No sound came from within, and at the silence [NAME]’ face clouded over.
SH	“‘Thank you, [NAME],’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’
SH	‘I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him.
SH	[NAME] [NAME] has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”
SH	I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier.
SH	The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”
SH	The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the [NAME]’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.
SH	“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment.
SH	He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table.
SH	I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in [NAME].
SH	Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear.
SH	Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.”
SH	He will be silent!
SH	[NAME] [NAME] had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
SH	When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “[NAME]!”
SH	“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he.
SH	There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’
SH	“Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.
SH	She little knew what.
SH	“There are a few of us who frequent the [NAME] [NAME], near the [NAME]—we are to be found in the [NAME] itself during the day, you understand.
SH	Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.
SH	Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.
SH	However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
SH	“But he is right.
SH	It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
SH	There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
SH	Slowly and solemnly he was borne into [NAME] [NAME] and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window.
SH	If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.
SH	He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready.
SH	I should not stay here.
SH	How could my hair have been locked in the drawer?
SH	“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to [NAME].
SH	I think that I have seen enough now, [NAME] [NAME], and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”
SH	“Precisely.”
SH	“There are several quiet little villages up there.”
SH	Did you see [NAME] [NAME] on the day before the wedding?”
SH	[NAME] THE ADVENTURE OF THE [NAME] BACHELOR  The [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.
SH	How he did it
TTC	“For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving [NAME], with them and you, at that hour.
TTC	I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside.
TTC	“If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”
TTC	How was it!”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the [NAME]’s room.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after [NAME] [NAME], like somebody at church.
TTC	My work is my business.
TTC	All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet.
TTC	“Where?”  “On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, [NAME], and on the same occasion.”
TTC	No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face.
TTC	These solemn words, which had been read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him.
TTC	How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of [NAME] in his mind, he did not discuss with himself.
TTC	Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.
TTC	“Let me interrupt you for a moment.
TTC	“You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Good.”  “[NAME] [NAME], physician.”
TTC	So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning.
TTC	“[NAME]!” said [NAME], clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; “you are a good boy!”
TTC	The [NAME] had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years.
TTC	“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined [NAME] [NAME], carelessly.
TTC	[NAME] has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in his old prison.
TTC	A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.
TTC	At every juryman’s vote, there was a roar.
TTC	I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade.
TTC	I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now.
TTC	[NAME] delivered to him last night.
TTC	The truth is, my dear [NAME],” [NAME] [NAME] glanced at the distant [NAME], and lowered his voice, “you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over [NAME] are involved.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] now signified to my [NAME], that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the [NAME] [NAME]’s father, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The people immediately behind [NAME] [NAME], explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands.
TTC	A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.
TTC	“Is that all?
TTC	Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”
TTC	All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air.
TTC	“The meaning, monsieur?”  “Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity?
TTC	“_Do_ you?”
TTC	I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it.
TTC	“Is it you,” said [NAME], in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into [NAME], “who married the daughter of [NAME] [NAME], once a prisoner in the [NAME] that is no more?”
TTC	Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of [NAME], would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] handed him a paper through the [NAME].
TTC	Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming.
TTC	A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.
TTC	She had employed herself in both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.
TTC	You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than usual?”
TTC	“And indeed, sir,” pursued [NAME] [NAME], not minding him, “I really don’t know what you have to do with the matter.
TTC	By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water.
TTC	“Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.
TTC	“I have no choice,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“What is this decree that the [NAME] spoke of?”
TTC	And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.
TTC	The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear.
TTC	“[NAME], I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog.”
TTC	The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.
TTC	cried she, wringing her hands.
TTC	“Good day, [NAME].”
TTC	I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the [NAME].
TTC	“A long time, I suppose,” said [NAME].
TTC	She knew full well that [NAME] [NAME] was the family’s devoted friend; [NAME] [NAME] knew full well that [NAME] [NAME] was the family’s malevolent enemy.
TTC	“‘What strength there is in these common bodies!’
TTC	I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it.
TTC	Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures.
TTC	“I think I am quite sure of it.”
TTC	So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised.
TTC	“Look among those fragments with care, [NAME].
TTC	There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.
TTC	“Will I promise?
TTC	“How have I done what I have done?” said [NAME]; “how do I do what I do?”
TTC	“I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced.
TTC	Look at me.
TTC	“I call myself the [NAME] of the firewood guillotine.
TTC	“From here, at eight.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
TTC	This favoured the desperate resolution [NAME] [NAME] had begun to make, that he would go to [NAME].
TTC	Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day.
TTC	If your suit should prosper, if [NAME] should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning.
TTC	“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.
TTC	Say all! _
TTC	“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
TTC	On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.
TTC	Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn out.
TTC	Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], I knew she was from home.
TTC	The little narrow, crooked town of [NAME] hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich.
TTC	I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!”
TTC	Early as it was, on the windy [NAME] morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.
TTC	They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night.
TTC	If it had been otherwise--’” [NAME] looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.
TTC	You are a wise counsellor.”
TTC	But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.
TTC	“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.
TTC	He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of.
TTC	Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began.
TTC	He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed [NAME] [NAME] much nearer to the lower [NAME] than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by [NAME] and [NAME], who had balances at [NAME]’s.
TTC	“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him.
TTC	After it is over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in [NAME] [NAME], and we will give information against these people at my Section.”
TTC	“Oh, [NAME], [NAME], dear [NAME]!” cried little [NAME], springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief.
TTC	“What are you?”
TTC	“[NAME]!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”
TTC	One drawbridge down!
TTC	I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling.
TTC	“My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her.
TTC	“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours.
TTC	You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way.
TTC	“No, I will _not_, sir,” returned [NAME] [NAME] as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice--“which
TTC	Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.
TTC	Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it.
TTC	“_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.
TTC	She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved.
TTC	“For the love of [NAME], of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!” was the poor prisoner’s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I hoped it was true?”
TTC	Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression.
TTC	Can such things last?
TTC	“You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”
TTC	Will you please to enter the carriage?’
TTC	Have I no power for good, with you, at all?”
TTC	The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture.
TTC	Now, a child.
TTC	He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the city.
TTC	It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious.
TTC	Let us stretch the hour or two.
TTC	But it’s not my business.
TTC	Responding to his softened manner, [NAME] [NAME] answered:  “Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no.
TTC	The gentleman had left [NAME], but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”
TTC	Environed by them, while the [NAME] and the [NAME] worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.
TTC	“And advancing?”
TTC	“If thou be changed into this shape by the will of [NAME],” say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so!
TTC	“Are we not going too slowly?
TTC	I declare to you, on the faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind.
TTC	[NAME]-time, and still no Hundreds of people.
TTC	The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
TTC	“Genuine truth, [NAME] [NAME], trust me!
TTC	“I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves.
TTC	Nor, how the lightest echo of their [NAME] home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her.
TTC	[NAME] and her father!
TTC	“That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it myself.”
TTC	You have acted and recounted faithfully.
TTC	In the king’s name, all of you!”  With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.
TTC	“With a daughter?”  “Yes.”
TTC	Her father thanks you.”
TTC	They told me a curious thing when I was there.”
TTC	At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a rarity--[NAME] [NAME], as it was the episcopal mode among his brother [NAME] of the provinces, [NAME] [NAME], and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress.
TTC	You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell.
TTC	Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.
TTC	You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!”
TTC	The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.
TTC	A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!
TTC	Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without [NAME]?
TTC	Thus [NAME] of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.
TTC	On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.
TTC	From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
TTC	A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there.
TTC	He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.
TTC	It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”
TTC	After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, [NAME] [NAME] conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral character.”
TTC	“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, [NAME], even better than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME]’s [NAME], an English gentleman who is now in [NAME], the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason.
TTC	When the [NAME]-[NAME] ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become.
TTC	If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of.
TTC	“I am going to tell you.
TTC	Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that [NAME] had lain in prison one year and three months when the [NAME] was thus steady and confident.
TTC	I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his--”  “I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting.
TTC	Both the women followed; the second woman being The [NAME].
TTC	the poor [NAME]!”
TTC	“Who took him out of it?”
TTC	“There is nobody to weep for me.”
TTC	When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell.
TTC	Do the days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”
TTC	Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”
TTC	I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his.
TTC	“If we ever get back to our native land,” said [NAME] [NAME], “you may rely upon my telling [NAME] [NAME] as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time.
TTC	Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often.
TTC	“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all respects--as he was then?”
TTC	With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, [NAME] [NAME] passed through this anxious time.
TTC	“Is that well?”
TTC	His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young [NAME], walking at his father’s side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest [NAME] [NAME]: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s feet, it formed the encampment for the day.
TTC	The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of [NAME] [NAME]; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that [NAME]’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.
TTC	“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?”
TTC	Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment!
TTC	She had installed herself, some time before, as [NAME] [NAME]’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished.
TTC	On [NAME], [NAME] [NAME] dined at the [NAME]’s table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to which no one but her [NAME] ever gained admittance.
TTC	Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.
TTC	That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.’”
TTC	She did, indeed, start.
TTC	[NAME]’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind, and with such a man as he had to do with.
TTC	“[NAME]-ho!” said the coachman.
TTC	It’s not long, you see, guard.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn [NAME] my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.
TTC	It is a young lady’s walking-shoe.
TTC	He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written [NAME] of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his absence.
TTC	But not for long.
TTC	How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.
TTC	Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:  “What is it, brother?
TTC	“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”  [NAME] [NAME] struck in, in his moody way.
TTC	The [NAME], whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
TTC	It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart.
TTC	This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost.
TTC	There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together.
TTC	Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all, for his [NAME]--his daughter[NAME], my dear [NAME].”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women.
TTC	[NAME] in [NAME]  [NAME] [NAME] did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence.
TTC	Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child.
TTC	“You and your yes, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer.
TTC	[NAME] was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the [NAME] [NAME] in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured [NAME] [NAME] with her eyes, every inch.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the [NAME]-yard.
TTC	At this the crowd roared approval.
TTC	Can I separate my father’s twin-[NAME], joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”
TTC	“You see me, citizen!”
TTC	He could now assure [NAME] that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the [NAME]’s hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.
TTC	“As I am at home myself,” said [NAME] [NAME], “I’ll go upstairs.”
TTC	Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.”
TTC	“_[NAME]_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger.
TTC	I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”
TTC	[NAME] added, by way of proviso.
TTC	“But I don’t say he don’t refer to it within himself.”
TTC	For answer he repeated, without any change of emphasis, the words:  “Do you know me?”
TTC	There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.
TTC	It was the year of Our [NAME] one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
TTC	“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear English dress?”
TTC	But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, “Take her, [NAME]!
TTC	“Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole [NAME]!”
TTC	On one of the fore-most chairs, stands The [NAME], looking about for her friend.
TTC	Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down--down on the steps of the [NAME] de [NAME] where the governor’s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of [NAME] [NAME] where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation.
TTC	Now, take this paper that [NAME] [NAME] has carried about him.
TTC	“After that there gallop from [NAME] [NAME], old lady, I won’t trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare.
TTC	It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance.
TTC	Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], idlest and most unpromising of men, was [NAME]’s great ally.
TTC	“I do not doubt it,” answered [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Where do you go, my wife?”
TTC	There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through.
TTC	You might as well flop as meditate.
TTC	“Oh, to be sure!
TTC	The valet come and gone, [NAME] the [NAME] walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night.
TTC	As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets.
TTC	“It wouldn’t do for you, [NAME].
TTC	“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.
TTC	It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting.
TTC	“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The [NAME] with alacrity, and kissing her cheek.
TTC	“Where could you wait for me?” asked [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME], about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.”
TTC	[NAME] started in his saddle.
TTC	In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face upon his breast.
TTC	“‘You had better see,’ he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
TTC	“They will be rapid.
TTC	You’re a nice woman!
TTC	She did not know that the girl was dead.
TTC	In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed.
TTC	Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.”
TTC	“When?”  “I was returning from [NAME] a few days afterwards, and, at [NAME], the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the voyage with me.”
TTC	Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain.
TTC	Can they not be induced to go faster?”  asks [NAME], clinging to the old man.
TTC	He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to [NAME] [NAME]’s face.
TTC	“I forget what it was you asked me.
TTC	Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, [NAME] alive!
TTC	“‘Nevertheless, [NAME], my sister married.
TTC	We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother [NAME] used to say.
TTC	“From [NAME]?”  “Yes.”
TTC	But, no, gentlemen,” said [NAME], looking all round, and snapping his fingers, “I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you’ll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious _protégés_.
TTC	Let me go to the door.”
TTC	The [NAME] laid the letter down so close to [NAME] that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name.
TTC	All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost.
TTC	The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the [NAME]’s room, where he was speaking with [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted [NAME].
TTC	“I did, [NAME].”
TTC	It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
TTC	He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
TTC	For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in.
TTC	Is not this the same place twice over?
TTC	Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground.
TTC	Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead.
TTC	The [NAME]’s [NAME]  It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of [NAME] the [NAME], with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door.
TTC	“You said something to me,” said [NAME] [NAME], breaking into a smile.
TTC	“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, [NAME] [NAME], or are we to divide them among us?”
TTC	But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home.
TTC	She presented herself to me as the wife of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity--never thought of such a thing.
TTC	As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.
TTC	But, from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of [NAME] [NAME], she had been true to her duties.
TTC	But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take [NAME]’s affections away from me.”
TTC	As the bank passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business.
TTC	You was to honour and obey; why the devil don’t you?”
TTC	How does she look?”
TTC	It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds.
TTC	Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the [NAME] looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.
TTC	[NAME] forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance.
TTC	“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand on hers, “command yourself.
TTC	You are a man of business, too.”
TTC	I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand.
TTC	“I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don’t expect to--what would do that,” answered [NAME].
TTC	Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators.
TTC	All we think, here, is how to live.
TTC	You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well.
TTC	The real Banking-house by [NAME] [NAME], the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there.
TTC	“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law.”
TTC	“It’s the damp, [NAME], what settles on my chest and voice,” said [NAME].
TTC	Thrown out of his honourable employment in [NAME], through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date--he knew that he had crossed the [NAME], and accepted service in [NAME]: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives.
TTC	“No.”  “How many were with him?”
TTC	Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.
TTC	“[NAME]!” said [NAME] [NAME], “it doesn’t need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures.
TTC	“Who is it?”
TTC	“What is the matter?
TTC	The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
TTC	Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother’s first duty is to blow her boy out?”
TTC	“Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said.
TTC	[NAME] was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application.
TTC	There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in [NAME], and his head was demanded.
TTC	“Ah! and good wine.
TTC	The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of [NAME] [NAME], in [NAME], where it was spilled.
TTC	There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his fardens--fardens!
TTC	For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination.
TTC	There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and [NAME] was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at [NAME] [NAME]’s door.
TTC	A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work.
TTC	A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
TTC	Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the [NAME] walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save [NAME]’s husband at last.
TTC	Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way [NAME] spoke, [NAME] [NAME] put on his hat
TTC	“Yes, citizen.”
TTC	“[NAME] 21, 1792.
TTC	“Good night, citizen.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] looks ill, [NAME] [NAME] has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”
TTC	“I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who’s your pretty witness?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence.
TTC	Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME]; nor will she miss now,” cries The [NAME], petulantly.
TTC	“Close them again.”
TTC	Turn me in some other direction before I go.”
TTC	The [NAME]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of [NAME], it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to [NAME], we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
TTC	Such masters were not at that time easily found; [NAME] that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of [NAME]’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters.
TTC	It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing.
TTC	Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.
TTC	He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.
TTC	“I take them into mine!” said [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] has been recognised by [NAME] [NAME] as the affectionate brother you have heard of,” said [NAME], “and has acknowledged the relationship.
TTC	“Shall I take her to a coach?
TTC	“I must say again, nonsense, nonsense!
TTC	In the meanwhile, be silent!”
TTC	“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The [NAME]:  “The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?
TTC	He had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with [NAME] on the road.
TTC	Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
TTC	The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him.
TTC	The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall.
TTC	Stir about there, now, for [NAME]!”
TTC	What has roughened your temper?
TTC	“The boy’s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true.
TTC	I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day.
TTC	It was a hard parting, though it was not for long.
TTC	The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.
TTC	But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.
TTC	[NAME], in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun.
TTC	As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”
TTC	“Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other.
TTC	It can’t be,” said the spy.
TTC	Louder yet, [NAME], with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardly bring her.
TTC	Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”
TTC	When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket.
TTC	It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air.
TTC	But I would leave the matter there.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while.
TTC	They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by [NAME], and found [NAME] weeping, alone.
TTC	As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, [NAME] was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.
TTC	A tremendous roar arose from the throat of [NAME] [NAME], and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.
TTC	When I took the tidings home, our father’s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
TTC	“‘You see, [NAME], I am going to use them,’ I replied, and said no more.
TTC	“I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.”
TTC	There, against an angle of a wall, he made a struggle to look about him.
TTC	“A daughter.
TTC	he asked, in due season.
TTC	Better to begin slowly.”
TTC	Ever pay him?
TTC	[NAME] and [NAME]”  “I know this messenger, guard,” said [NAME] [NAME], getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window.
TTC	By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman.
TTC	He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air.
TTC	He did not seek it, but repeated them and went on.
TTC	Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was already calling at the door when he got there.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street.
TTC	The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop.
TTC	[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME], through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard.
TTC	She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”
TTC	That friend and fellow-[NAME], who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he?”
TTC	I am an official.”
TTC	It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
TTC	“The picturesque doctor’s daughter, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the [NAME], but at nothing else.
TTC	[NAME], standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down.
TTC	Never in a debtors’ prison?--Come, once again.
TTC	Their conference was very short, but very decided.
TTC	He entreated her, for her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the [NAME], on that old [NAME] under the dear old plane-tree in the garden.
TTC	“I fear not yet.
TTC	and the [NAME] presented himself.
TTC	Darkness  [NAME] [NAME] paused in the street, not quite decided where to go.
TTC	I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it.”
TTC	No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door.
TTC	“Yes, yes, yes,” returned [NAME] [NAME], drying his eyes, “you are right.
TTC	“It must be an immense satisfaction!”
TTC	His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in [NAME] [NAME]’s ears long after he had ceased.
TTC	On his answering in the affirmative, “Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.”
TTC	Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort.
TTC	Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, [NAME] dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn.
TTC	Who threw that?”
TTC	In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else.
TTC	When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there.
TTC	“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope.
TTC	“First,” said [NAME] [NAME], who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this, never no more will I do it, never no more!”
TTC	your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?”  “You say truly, [NAME] [NAME]; I think they would be.”
TTC	At first, his mind reverted to [NAME], and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city.
TTC	“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.”
TTC	“‘If it had been otherwise;’” [NAME]’s hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; “‘I never should have used the longer opportunity.
TTC	“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks.
TTC	“I am the Resurrection and the [NAME], [NAME] the [NAME]: he that [NAME] in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] in me shall never die.”
TTC	Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him.
TTC	“But it does matter,” [NAME] [NAME] urged.
TTC	When he called at my lodgings in [NAME].
TTC	The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature [NAME] bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful [NAME] were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in [NAME]-[NAME].
TTC	It had never been a good eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of [NAME]’s pride, [NAME]’s luxury, and a mole’s blindness--but it had dropped out and was gone.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by [NAME]’s arm as he held by the turnkey’s.
TTC	On the afternoon of a certain fine [NAME] when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] walked along the sunny streets from [NAME] where he lived, on his way to dine with the [NAME].
TTC	“From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, [NAME] heretofore the [NAME], the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
TTC	At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well.
TTC	He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand.
TTC	“I perceive that, happily for me, the [NAME] of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.
TTC	“I warn’t doing no harm,” [NAME] [NAME] protested, rubbing his cheek.
TTC	“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote.
TTC	“Let us hope so,” said the uncle.
TTC	You are free from that misfortune, however.”
TTC	Free and happy, back in the old house in [NAME] (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with [NAME] again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away.
TTC	“Like these in shape and size?”  “Possibly, but indeed I don’t know, although they stood whispering very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that they looked at papers.”
TTC	“There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs.
TTC	These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from [NAME] morning unto [NAME] night.
TTC	“[NAME] bless you for your sweet compassion!”
TTC	The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke.
TTC	Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, [NAME] [NAME] never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health.
TTC	It was easier for [NAME] [NAME] to look in at [NAME]’s, than to look out of [NAME]’s.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband.
TTC	“Yes, [NAME],” repeated [NAME] [NAME] sitting down to tea.
TTC	“‘Then, with that man’s permission and even with his aid, his brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, [NAME], if it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion, for a little while.
TTC	“[NAME], dear darling of my soul.
TTC	“You wish you were going yourself?
TTC	O, look at her, dear [NAME]!
TTC	He shook his head.
TTC	One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,” he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint.
TTC	A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying, “Follow me, [NAME]!” and he followed into a large dark room, at a distance.
TTC	*****  “The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable.
TTC	“Or both,” said [NAME].
TTC	With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections.
TTC	“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow?
TTC	They so harnessed him and drove him.
TTC	Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her.
TTC	His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted.
TTC	“What of your husband, the forester?
TTC	“Yes, indeed.
TTC	I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me.
TTC	They heard him mutter, “One Hundred and Five, [NAME] [NAME];” and when he looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him.
TTC	“They tell me so.”
TTC	“‘Gentlemen,’ I returned, ‘I am that [NAME] [NAME] of whom you speak so graciously.’
TTC	The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow.
TTC	A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done.
TTC	What?”  “I mean of him.
TTC	He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.
TTC	d’ye mind me?
TTC	“It is so,” assented [NAME] again.
TTC	“Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.
TTC	The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at [NAME].
TTC	As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine.
TTC	“Apparently it must be.
TTC	A-a-matter of business--don’t be distressed.
TTC	It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
TTC	“The gracious and merciful [NAME] forbid!” cried [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	It is in the present mode.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] thought it might be best.
TTC	There is another spy commissioned for our quarter.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the [NAME] and shot the people.
TTC	Will you cause that to be done for me?”
TTC	“Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?”
TTC	The [NAME]  Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard.
TTC	That was all the writing.
TTC	“Can’t-be.
TTC	Don’t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”
TTC	“I am the resurrection and the life, [NAME] the [NAME]: he that [NAME] in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] in me, shall never die.”
TTC	If it had not been [NAME], it would have been another.
TTC	Impossible, here in raging [NAME], with [NAME] filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
TTC	His judges sat upon the [NAME] in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.
TTC	How little I thought what I was doing!
TTC	“I have come back, [NAME], as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away.
TTC	“I can pass in and out when I choose.”
TTC	With him, I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night.
TTC	The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and [NAME] [NAME] emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in [NAME]--except two, for which he looked in vain.
TTC	“You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined [NAME], shouldering the rejoinder at him; “no, [NAME], it’s my duty to tell you--and I tell you to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society.
TTC	Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust at me with all his skill for his life.’
TTC	Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother.
TTC	“[NAME],” repeated madame.
TTC	Looking at the [NAME] and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men.
TTC	All the women knitted.
TTC	Lastly, came my [NAME] himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
TTC	“A despatch sent after you from over yonder.
TTC	When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.
TTC	“I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age.
TTC	So I have made up my mind.
TTC	The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which [NAME] [NAME] took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the [NAME] lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.
TTC	I am so ignorant.
TTC	That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others.
TTC	In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the gentleman came on board--”  “Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the [NAME], knitting his brows.
TTC	You talk of desperation.
TTC	“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined politeness; “I would not be sure of that.
TTC	I never saw her more.
TTC	The hour was come, when [NAME] [NAME] was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do.
TTC	“I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me.
TTC	Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become.
TTC	That, in the prison he had found a self-appointed [NAME] sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells.
TTC	In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided.
TTC	As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed [NAME] and fire.
TTC	His surname was [NAME], and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of [NAME], he had received the added appellation of [NAME].
TTC	Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it.
TTC	The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth.
TTC	“[NAME]! Listen to him!”
TTC	How can the women and the children draw water!
TTC	A third man got up and went out.
TTC	His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
TTC	I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
TTC	The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent.
TTC	“Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little [NAME], drawing close to her.
TTC	And indeed she never did.
TTC	Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”
TTC	For, I tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin, in this manner.
TTC	It lay back on the pillow of [NAME] the [NAME].
TTC	It attracted [NAME] [NAME]’s eyes to [NAME]’s face, which was turned to the fire.
TTC	Don’t shrink from anything I say.
TTC	The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of [NAME], and that he would be in effect the most desolate of [NAME], if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber.
TTC	“[NAME],” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong.”
TTC	Through the fire and through the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.
TTC	[NAME]’s hand moved back to his breast no more.
TTC	“Then you shall likewise know why.
TTC	He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease.
TTC	In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.
TTC	“So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of [NAME] [NAME]?”  “A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted if the [NAME] had drawn a blank.”
TTC	“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed.
TTC	All this while, [NAME], with his pipe in his mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up and down through life.
TTC	For the rest, the [NAME] [NAME] was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
TTC	But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it.
TTC	Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell.
TTC	“Well!” said [NAME], with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
TTC	Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that [NAME] [NAME] had to do with the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that [NAME] had got in those latter days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference.
TTC	She seemed to raise it (the listener’s eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.
TTC	“[NAME],” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old [NAME] [NAME] of old [NAME] [NAME] was to shoulder him into it, “your way is, and always was, a lame way.
TTC	“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes.
TTC	Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways.
TTC	So polite and so impressible was [NAME], that the [NAME] and the [NAME] [NAME] had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all [NAME].
TTC	Show him that shoe you are working at.
TTC	I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing.
TTC	“[NAME], ay, why not!” cried the sawyer.
TTC	All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
TTC	Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature.
TTC	The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of my establishment.
TTC	Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, [NAME] [NAME] paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] again.
TTC	He was tearing himself apart from her.
TTC	Who was he?”
TTC	What I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.’
TTC	I may find a use for it one day.
TTC	This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the [NAME] [NAME]’s ears.
TTC	Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind.
TTC	he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.
TTC	He did it for me.
TTC	He was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels.
TTC	And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
TTC	After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of [NAME], or all drawn up together singing a [NAME] song.
TTC	I adjure you, do not recall that!”
TTC	How do they call that man?”
TTC	But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.
TTC	“And you,” returned [NAME], busy concocting the punch, “are such a sensitive and poetical [NAME]”  “Come!” rejoined [NAME], laughing boastfully, “though I don’t prefer any claim to being the soul of [NAME] (for I hope I know better), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.”
TTC	Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake.
TTC	The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.
TTC	“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness.
TTC	“Well?”  “[NAME], it is nothing.
TTC	“‘A brother.’
TTC	You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose.
TTC	“Gentlemen--my wife!”
TTC	“Assuredly I did.”
TTC	It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations.
TTC	The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach.
TTC	Here again: [NAME] [NAME]’s inquiries into [NAME] [NAME]’s personal history had established the fact that her brother [NAME] was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction.
TTC	He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
TTC	Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
TTC	In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on [NAME] who had been taken on [NAME]; now, burning people in the hand at [NAME] by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of [NAME] [NAME]; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence.
TTC	Do you go with me to the [NAME]?”
TTC	What can I do for my friend?
TTC	“Quite, my child.”
TTC	* * Let us ride on again, for [NAME]’s sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake!
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s eyes were again attracted to his face.
TTC	Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn.
TTC	“The younger brother impatiently rejoined, ‘With twelve o’clock?’
TTC	That was done too, and the [NAME] went on with his supper.
TTC	“Shall I show her to you?
TTC	And off his head comes!”
TTC	I want no more words.”
TTC	Ask him, is that so.”
TTC	The prison of [NAME] [NAME] was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it.
TTC	“Hush, dear!
TTC	The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women.
TTC	The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, [NAME].
TTC	The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign.
TTC	“Then I say yes,” said [NAME]: “I won’t go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night.
TTC	He needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep.
TTC	“It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner.
TTC	“‘Do you honour me with your attention, [NAME]?’
TTC	Do you not believe it is the truth?”
TTC	He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means [NAME] brother, said through her tears, “[NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	“You mistake me for another.
TTC	You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter.
TTC	“Ah!” returned [NAME] [NAME], shaking her head.
TTC	“A craven who abandoned his post,” said another--this [NAME] had been got out of [NAME], legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of hay--“some years ago.”
TTC	She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look.
TTC	She also bestowed a British cough on [NAME] [NAME]; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.
TTC	I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.”
TTC	It may be too late, I don’t know, but let it not be a minute later!”
TTC	“I am not a shoemaker by trade?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear [NAME] company--set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in [NAME]-procession through the streets.
TTC	*****  “When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
TTC	He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.
TTC	“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly.
TTC	Why so?”  “That is what you are not to ask me.
TTC	“She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her greatest desire was, to help that sister.
TTC	“[NAME] here, [NAME]!”
TTC	There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his snuff-[NAME] in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.
TTC	And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements.
TTC	In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation.
TTC	I arrived at [NAME] [NAME][NAME], to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.
TTC	She was in great agitation.
TTC	Once again he touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,  “My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived.”
TTC	“As she had mentioned her husband’s name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter.
TTC	Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves.
TTC	Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench beside him.
TTC	Here, they were shown into a little room, where [NAME] [NAME] was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while [NAME] sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.
TTC	I have an association with the name--and with the face.”
TTC	I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions.”
TTC	He held the letter out inquiringly; and [NAME] looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and [NAME] looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in [NAME] or in [NAME], concerning the [NAME] who was not to be found.
TTC	Had he come on board alone?”
TTC	Let him take care of his face!”
TTC	You’ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child.”
TTC	“I hope, [NAME],” pleaded the abashed [NAME] [NAME], “that a gentleman like yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don’t say it is, but even if it wos.
TTC	May it otherwise be light and happy!”
TTC	“See, there is my husband!”
TTC	Now, what do you want with me?”
TTC	I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary [NAME].”
TTC	As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
TTC	On the crowd’s opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a [NAME]-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.
TTC	“At that time--I may ask, at what time, [NAME]?”
TTC	“Now, look here!
TTC	“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in [NAME] [NAME], touching the unhappy fate of poor [NAME].”
TTC	He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep.
TTC	The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.
TTC	“No?”  “No.
TTC	He even showed surprise when he saw [NAME] [NAME], and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.
TTC	“Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air.
TTC	“Still,” said [NAME], “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”
TTC	Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, [NAME] [NAME] felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?
TTC	“She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
TTC	Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him.
TTC	“Yes,” returned [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”
TTC	The [NAME] [NAME] Rises  [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when [NAME] [NAME] sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
TTC	He knew her to be so, without looking at her, and said:  “[NAME] forgive me, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging.
TTC	She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.
TTC	“You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made.
TTC	“[NAME] me!
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], good night, [NAME] bless you, sir!
TTC	“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”
TTC	“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the [NAME], with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
TTC	[NAME], ha, ha!
TTC	“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”
TTC	The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made it known to [NAME] [NAME] that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left [NAME].
TTC	So very great is the improvement [NAME] has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
TTC	“You go down here, and straight through the street, and past the [NAME]”  “To the [NAME] with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape.
TTC	Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”
TTC	“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”
TTC	I love it.
TTC	Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over.
TTC	“[NAME]-ho-hum!” said [NAME] [NAME], cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we must have patience and wait: that’s all.
TTC	“They say, those boastful [NAME], that it is the [NAME] of many.
TTC	They were in number as the weeks of the year.
TTC	Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.
TTC	“I thought so.
TTC	In Secret  The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards [NAME] from [NAME] in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two.
TTC	As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.
TTC	“Well, sir!” cried [NAME] [NAME], thoroughly heated by his indifference, “business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing.
TTC	What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME], except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to [NAME] [NAME] and her protector, though they had been all ears.
TTC	“Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?”
TTC	He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed [NAME].
TTC	His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from [NAME] [NAME]; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot.
TTC	The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began gnawing another finger.
TTC	“Had they conferred together?”
TTC	For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him.
TTC	I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.’
TTC	They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few!
TTC	I wish for your sake [NAME] [NAME] was not a [NAME] of the [NAME].”
TTC	“Oh indeed!” said [NAME] [NAME], bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the [NAME] afar off.
TTC	“If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest.
TTC	I doubt if I should abuse the permission.
TTC	I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from [NAME] at the risk of being ducked to death, and that [NAME] was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham.
TTC	“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention.
TTC	“He is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found.
TTC	What has happened?
TTC	“Oh dear you, sir?
TTC	We have been counting on your return these three or four days past.
TTC	Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last [NAME] had slept.
TTC	My darling pretty!”
TTC	He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him.
TTC	“It is a painful reflection to me,” said [NAME] [NAME], quite astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong.
TTC	he asked, as the result of that conference.
TTC	[NAME] may be, but is the property?
TTC	He had heard of her going to the prison every day.
TTC	“Straight!” said [NAME], with a plump of his fist on the desk.
TTC	He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, [NAME].”
TTC	I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me more courage.”
TTC	With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
TTC	It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob.
TTC	What proof had he of this?
TTC	“He’s hoarser than suits me, is [NAME].”)
TTC	“I know,” said [NAME], respectfully, “how can I fail to know, [NAME] [NAME], I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and [NAME] [NAME] there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.
TTC	A crown to drink.
TTC	He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent.
TTC	she asked him.
TTC	“In the dead of the night.
TTC	By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped.
TTC	But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes.
TTC	And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast.
TTC	Is that the sort of fellow?
TTC	“[NAME]?” repeated the old gentleman, “[NAME]?
TTC	“I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”
TTC	Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.”
TTC	There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
TTC	“‘Is she dead?’
TTC	He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since.
TTC	“The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance.
TTC	“What the [NAME]!
TTC	Take up the pen and finish.
TTC	With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, [NAME] looked out.
TTC	They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.
TTC	I may go on?”
TTC	equally like smoke, if not more so.
TTC	Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.
TTC	They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes.
TTC	“Going?” echoed madame.
TTC	the posting-house.
TTC	He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national.
TTC	“On a certain [NAME] night in [NAME] one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between [NAME] and [NAME] by the mail?”
TTC	“But it’s not my business,” said he.
TTC	When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and [NAME], the whole scene like a lifeless desert.
TTC	“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.
TTC	May it soon terminate happily!
TTC	That time passed, and her little [NAME] lay on her bosom.
TTC	I am safe.”
TTC	Now, pray say no more about it.
TTC	The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon [NAME].
TTC	And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
TTC	“I forgot it,” he said.
TTC	He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him.
TTC	It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live.
TTC	That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between [NAME] and [NAME], on secret business of which he could give no honest account.
TTC	As he did so, a small case in which the [NAME] was accustomed to carry the lists of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor.
TTC	They both listened.
TTC	She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a farmer’s house in the [NAME] country.
TTC	She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her.
TTC	When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.
TTC	“Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong.
TTC	See now, see now!
TTC	It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.
TTC	We so much regret it!
TTC	Are they very like each other?”
TTC	The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
TTC	[NAME] was the first to speak:  “The last chance is gone: it was not much.
TTC	Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and [NAME]”
TTC	Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!”
TTC	One [NAME]  Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in [NAME], than one memorable evening when the [NAME] and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together.
TTC	“You’re at it agin, are you?”
TTC	The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, “It must burn.”
TTC	There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.”
TTC	What is it?
TTC	“Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn--”  “Let us shudder too.
TTC	“Do I know her?”
TTC	A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.
TTC	They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where [NAME] [NAME] immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed.
TTC	“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in [NAME] here.”
TTC	“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said [NAME], when they had listened for a while.
TTC	The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity.
TTC	And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”
TTC	Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat.
TTC	I go on duty soon, and can’t overstay my time.
TTC	You can bear a little more?”
TTC	He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on [NAME] [NAME], and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage.
TTC	No. Had not procured them himself, for instance?
TTC	I can’t see.”
TTC	There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets.
TTC	It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand.”
TTC	“I hear, messieurs.”
TTC	“Eh, well!
TTC	The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the [NAME] [NAME]--when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of [NAME].
TTC	“Never.”  “Go and see him when he has a good batch.
TTC	This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge.
TTC	“Are they both yours to renounce?
TTC	[NAME] could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing [NAME]; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of [NAME], without the aid of four strong men besides the [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s hands were at her bosom.
TTC	He married--an English lady--and I was one of the trustees.
TTC	I--Were you going there now?” asked [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and good-fellowship, what he did mean?
TTC	These are again the words of [NAME] [NAME], as he clasps his hands, and looks upward.
TTC	This is not your proper occupation.
TTC	“Is there any noise in the streets now?”
TTC	Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity.
TTC	“Does [NAME] go with us?” inquired [NAME] [NAME], seeing that she moved as they moved.
TTC	If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth.
TTC	I hold you till one or other of [NAME] faints or dies!”
TTC	The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of [NAME] [NAME] fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over [NAME] shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.
TTC	Give it me!”
TTC	You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”
TTC	Let that be!
TTC	He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
TTC	And when [NAME] [NAME] saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.
TTC	I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her.
TTC	This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.
TTC	She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the [NAME], but whom he directly remembered as [NAME].
TTC	And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side.
TTC	Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again.
TTC	The quick noise and movement of the court’s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when [NAME] stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.
TTC	Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, [NAME] [NAME] took her way along the streets.
TTC	The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.
TTC	They came, and the [NAME] [NAME] was sunny with a child’s laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.
TTC	“You are a good man and a true friend,” said [NAME], in an altered voice.
TTC	[NAME] prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of [NAME] [NAME] escort through the [NAME] streets in [NAME][NAME][NAME], one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine.
TTC	“Business!
TTC	His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
TTC	“That my father,” said [NAME], hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has much influence around him.”
TTC	he said to [NAME], as he took his seat at table.
TTC	It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.”
TTC	“I do not doubt your loving [NAME]; you may be satisfied of it.”
TTC	“[NAME] from the other world!”
TTC	Yes, but we don’t know what reason there is in it.
TTC	Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.
TTC	It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words.
TTC	One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses.
TTC	“Here is a visitor.”
TTC	Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, [NAME] [NAME] bustled into the chair, and was carried off to [NAME]’s.
TTC	I don’t know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here, thank [NAME]; but I have been so put out all day, and I am not as young as I was!
TTC	There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father.
TTC	The great door clanged behind him, and [NAME] the [NAME] crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; [NAME] with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor [NAME], had felt the weight when his [NAME] was angry.
TTC	Don’t let your sober face elate you, however; you don’t know what it may come to.
TTC	“How do you know it?”
TTC	That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must positively find the prisoner [NAME], and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not.
TTC	We had that man before us at the [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp!
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at [NAME] to see if it were in his mind.
TTC	“‘She heard me, and ran in.
TTC	“Well!” observed [NAME] [NAME], beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that seems probable, too.”
TTC	Much of that wouldn’t do for you, [NAME]!
TTC	“My dear [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], with cheerful confidence, “you touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away.
TTC	Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, [NAME] began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.
TTC	“On my way yonder,” said [NAME] [NAME], with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing.
TTC	“I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”
TTC	The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too.
TTC	That might not be so long as the [NAME] supposed.
TTC	“I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to [NAME] [NAME], “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that [NAME] of which he has spoken.
TTC	A place of business in [NAME] like [NAME]’s place of business in [NAME], would soon have driven the [NAME] out of its mind and into the [NAME].
TTC	those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.
TTC	“[NAME],” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly.
TTC	“[NAME], he was whiter than the miller.
TTC	“Yes, sir.
TTC	Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
TTC	“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir.
TTC	Looking about him while in this state of suspense, [NAME] [NAME] observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult.
TTC	The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?
TTC	[NAME] left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it.
TTC	I mean I am a man of more--[NAME]”  “Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested [NAME].
TTC	Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was.
TTC	It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in [NAME] [NAME], intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in [NAME].
TTC	Would you not?”  “Truly yes, madame.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], only daughter of [NAME] [NAME], the good physician who sits there.”
TTC	“I believe it is something of that sort,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	She had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband’s share in it, and my being resorted to.
TTC	You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family.
TTC	“I can’t say.”
TTC	Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.
TTC	Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him.
TTC	Some were standing; some seated.
TTC	Thus, [NAME]’s, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on [NAME] [NAME] instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.
TTC	“[NAME]!” said [NAME], in a determined voice, “are we ready?”
TTC	[NAME] refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
TTC	“I go so far as to say, [NAME], moreover,” proceeded [NAME] [NAME], with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words be took down and took to [NAME] [NAME] through yourself--that wot my opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as [NAME] [NAME] may be a flopping at the present time.”
TTC	He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings.
TTC	“Far rather would I never see you again, dear [NAME], though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall.
TTC	Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, [NAME] [NAME] presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg.
TTC	But, what then?
TTC	“What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”
TTC	Whom have we within?
TTC	Is he fit for the journey?” asked [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Because,” said [NAME] [NAME], “I wouldn’t go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”
TTC	Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for [NAME] [NAME] so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into [NAME] under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone.
TTC	“[NAME] dear!
TTC	“Am I not prosperous?” asked [NAME].
TTC	The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the [NAME] of [NAME], where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.
TTC	“Say of you, [NAME] [NAME], and although I know better--although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget it!”
TTC	“More than that; [NAME] [NAME] is, for all reasons, best out of [NAME].
TTC	What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of [NAME] [NAME] behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said [NAME] (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of [NAME]?
TTC	The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it.
TTC	“Very little to-night, but all he knows.
TTC	Now, you think I may not be right?”
TTC	Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”
TTC	On the marriage morning, [NAME] [NAME] had made it his one urgent and express request to [NAME] [NAME], that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the [NAME], dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.
TTC	“If you had,” pursued [NAME] [NAME], “perhaps you would attend to it.”
TTC	It was too much the way of [NAME] under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible [NAME] as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched millions in [NAME], and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw.
TTC	Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think.
TTC	He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress.
TTC	“You see,” said [NAME] [NAME], turning to him after an uneasy pause, “it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man’s mind.
TTC	[NAME] shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight.
TTC	“Since it is my misfortune, [NAME] [NAME], to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me--”  “Don’t say that, [NAME] [NAME], for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could.
TTC	“My brave wife,” returned [NAME], standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this.
TTC	I was ready to go.”
TTC	He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
TTC	“I told you you had a remarkable face, [NAME] [NAME],” observed [NAME], coolly.
TTC	He readily responded to his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand in both his own.
TTC	“I can bear it, dear [NAME].
TTC	“I tell you,” said [NAME], “that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin.
TTC	How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that reference to [NAME] [NAME], which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
TTC	He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days.
TTC	With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.
TTC	Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the night.
TTC	“And of me, I am sure,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of [NAME], in [NAME], was [NAME]’s [NAME].
TTC	A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.
TTC	He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He had asked the prisoner, aboard the [NAME] packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
TTC	It bore the words in the [NAME]’s writing:  “[NAME] is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
TTC	That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.
TTC	Thus the evening wore away with the [NAME] family, until [NAME] [NAME] was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them.
TTC	You want a promise from me.
TTC	It’s a dreadful remembrance.
TTC	[NAME], you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t suit _your_ line of business!
TTC	Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, [NAME]?”  “Not of late years.
TTC	Now, pray let us think!
TTC	All the voices were in the prisoner’s favour, and the [NAME] declared him free.
TTC	Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back.
TTC	With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep.
TTC	If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
TTC	“My father!”
TTC	My duty is to my country and the [NAME].
TTC	I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”
TTC	“[NAME] there!
TTC	With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
TTC	This time, [NAME] [NAME] feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now.
TTC	I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman’s dress.
TTC	“Have you finished your repast, friend?”
TTC	The young lady, my good sir,” said [NAME] [NAME], mildly tapping the [NAME] arm, “the young lady.
TTC	“‘[NAME],’ said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, ‘in the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them.
TTC	In this, his prosperity consisted.
TTC	A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.
TTC	In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, [NAME] [NAME] bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips.
TTC	“What a night it has been!
TTC	There was none.
TTC	“These fools know nothing.
TTC	The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
TTC	“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned [NAME].
TTC	I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.
TTC	In the meanwhile, [NAME] would wait alone by the fire for the [NAME].
TTC	“I am thankful!”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] knuckled his forehead, as [NAME] [NAME] and the spy returned from the dark room.
TTC	You are a turnkey at the [NAME]?”
TTC	“Well then!
TTC	“Good night, [NAME] [NAME],” said the man of business.
TTC	His appearance; is it known?”
TTC	When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.
TTC	“[NAME], if you wish to take something to eat, you can.
TTC	“I don’t care about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself.
TTC	And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”  “It is true, madame.”
TTC	But, [NAME] [NAME] thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way asking himself, “Why not?”
TTC	“It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.
TTC	Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune.
TTC	“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully.
TTC	The [NAME] sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground.
TTC	The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.
TTC	“I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking.
TTC	He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be?
TTC	“Perfectly.”
TTC	But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of [NAME] were perfectly dressed.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to [NAME] [NAME], whom he warmly thanked.
TTC	The resemblance between him and [NAME] was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.
TTC	“Don’t call me [NAME].
TTC	“Good day!”
TTC	Within an hour or two from this.”
TTC	“Happy to say, I never knew him.”
TTC	“For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said:  “‘There is another patient.’
TTC	The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea.
TTC	A good journey!”
TTC	Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower.
TTC	“Whose voice was that?”
TTC	The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where [NAME] had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival.
TTC	No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly.
TTC	Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks.
TTC	They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more.
TTC	Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get much by it, even if it wos so.
TTC	“Meanwhile,” said the [NAME], “I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not.
TTC	“There is nothing more to do,” said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow.
TTC	You_, your father’s daughter!”
TTC	“Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious!”
TTC	It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago.
TTC	The [NAME] of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and [NAME] was by this time scattered far and wide.
TTC	The [NAME] assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.
TTC	Now, I hear [NAME]’s step coming to the door.
TTC	The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass.
TTC	If ever there were love in the world, I love her.
TTC	A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the [NAME], which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
TTC	They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees.
TTC	And she did.
TTC	The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it.
TTC	“As I was saying; if [NAME] [NAME] had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the [NAME] of [NAME].”
TTC	“The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
TTC	“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t.
TTC	That’s about it.
TTC	“Good day!”
TTC	I suppose so.
TTC	Her father rose with her, and kept her hand drawn through his arm.
TTC	“My husband, it is so.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended.
TTC	Can I in no way repay your confidence?
TTC	Who made the [NAME] [NAME] a judge of beauty?
TTC	I have walked two nights without resting.
TTC	“That’s right; all safe and well!
TTC	Ten o’clock at night?”
TTC	“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised spectacles upon him.
TTC	You [NAME] are cold, it seems to me.”
TTC	When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	“It is under my arm,” said [NAME] [NAME], in smothered tones, “you shall not draw it.
TTC	“Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.
TTC	Where is it?”
TTC	“As to the future,” said the [NAME], recovering firmness, “I should have great hope.
TTC	“I don’t know, [NAME] [NAME]; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it.
TTC	Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken.
TTC	“Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last [NAME], abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the ruffian herd.
TTC	“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said [NAME], with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give me an advantage over you.
TTC	“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said [NAME], with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it.
TTC	They were always ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!
TTC	To think that there might have been a [NAME] [NAME], any time these fifty years almost!”
TTC	“Will you accompany me,” said [NAME] [NAME], joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”
TTC	“Do you play?”
TTC	Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of [NAME], and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.
TTC	I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, ‘Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two [NAME] brothers, as that [NAME] paper describes, is my family.
TTC	Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top.
TTC	It was remarkable; but, the taste of [NAME] [NAME] seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	As he went out at the prisoners’ door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father’s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.
TTC	“I take no answer from you.
TTC	As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with [NAME], and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, [NAME] [NAME] went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.
TTC	Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father’s honest calling, [NAME] [NAME], keeping as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view.
TTC	How should a repetition of it be treated?
TTC	“You will see.”
TTC	You cannot answer this.
TTC	“What did you make of it, [NAME]?”
TTC	He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun.
TTC	When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate.
TTC	“Thérèse!”
TTC	The people had all poured out to the show in the streets.
TTC	most unhappily, I am!”
TTC	The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper.
TTC	We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn.
TTC	If the [NAME] of [NAME] had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct.
TTC	Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
TTC	The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they peeped.
TTC	“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
TTC	The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	This boy is a getting too many for _me_!” said [NAME] [NAME], surveying him.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen.
TTC	She calls you [NAME], and she must know, being your sister.
TTC	It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes.
TTC	“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street.
TTC	“I think so.
TTC	“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech.
TTC	It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” [NAME] [NAME] said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.
TTC	There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner.
TTC	He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him, by his name, what he has in his hand.
TTC	“Don’t look!” cried [NAME] [NAME], absolutely desperate.
TTC	“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing [NAME] [NAME], “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.
TTC	You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed.
TTC	Whereas them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop--catch ’em at it!
TTC	I knew it from himself.
TTC	“Really, [NAME] [NAME],” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have not asked myself the question.”
TTC	Do you hear?”
TTC	she cries, in her shrill tones.
TTC	“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was brought to the [NAME] [NAME] they found these upon my sleeve.
TTC	“Oh! Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass.
TTC	All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine.
TTC	It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
TTC	When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
TTC	“I think it probable,” said the [NAME], breaking silence with an effort, “that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.”
TTC	“[NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], apostrophising himself in his usual way, “you see that there [NAME] that day, and you see with your own eyes that he was a young ’[NAME] and a straight made ’[NAME].”
TTC	By-and-bye, they went into the house.
TTC	“One word,” the [NAME] entreated.
TTC	“They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on either side.
TTC	“Such are not my orders.
TTC	Can I not recall you--forgive me [NAME] a better course?
TTC	This new life of the [NAME]’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious [NAME] [NAME] saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
TTC	He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them.
TTC	I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless.
TTC	I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of [NAME]!
TTC	[NAME] took it up, and there was a folded paper in it.
TTC	Call yourself a religious woman?
TTC	I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.
TTC	“Ah, my cherished!” cried The [NAME]; and embraced her.
TTC	Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”
TTC	“He remains up there in his iron cage some days.
TTC	Write on; there are but a few words more.”
TTC	The [NAME]-shop  A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street.
TTC	I shall never be better than I am.
TTC	At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind.
TTC	But this [NAME] has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read.”
TTC	“[NAME]! Disguised, but the same man.
TTC	He added the last words, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.
TTC	“Now and then,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Still, [NAME] [NAME], pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and [NAME].
TTC	The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
TTC	“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there may be, or there will be.
TTC	“That must never be,” croaked [NAME] [NAME]; “no one must escape.
TTC	If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it!
TTC	“It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I?
TTC	“I will do,” [NAME] doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you.
TTC	So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
TTC	“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
TTC	The papers are handed out, and read.
TTC	Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused.
TTC	“It will die out,” said [NAME] the [NAME], glancing at his hands, “directly.”
TTC	Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord.
TTC	Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently attentive.
TTC	My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.”
TTC	I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison.
TTC	What is your name, my gentle angel?”
TTC	It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards.
TTC	“There, there, there!
TTC	There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, [NAME] [NAME], smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another.
TTC	I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul.
TTC	He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”
TTC	I say farewell to her by you.”
TTC	This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointed out.
TTC	“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned [NAME] [NAME], “and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me.
TTC	“I throw up.
TTC	Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that [NAME] [NAME], who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for.
TTC	But I think their withdrawing is in your favour.”
TTC	[NAME], unable to restrain himself any longer, touched [NAME] [NAME] on the shoulder, and said:  “I know the fellow.”
TTC	[NAME] was gone; had been besieged in its [NAME] and “suspended,” when the last tidings came over.
TTC	She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with the line round his wrist), [NAME] said, as soon as he could make his voice heard:  “Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived.
TTC	What is that in your hand?
TTC	I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”
TTC	“Let it do so.”
TTC	And that aid was his own.
TTC	“Come, then, my children,” said [NAME].
TTC	But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time.”
TTC	Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, [NAME]!”
TTC	Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, “I don’t know her.
TTC	I cry in my sleep where is he?
TTC	“And here he wrote ‘a poor physician.’
TTC	Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city gates.
TTC	That’s a card not to be beaten.
TTC	asked the lively boy.
TTC	“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.”
TTC	Let the [NAME] play the winning game; I will play the losing one.
TTC	When do you cease to work?”
TTC	So the guard of the [NAME] mail thought to himself, that [NAME] night in [NAME], one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up [NAME]’s [NAME], as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
TTC	As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it.
TTC	“I will be submissive to you.
TTC	“It shall be done!”
TTC	I taught myself.
TTC	“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	You are not”--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--“a prisoner?”
TTC	“He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”
TTC	Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
TTC	It is good, until recalled.
TTC	And by one other.”
TTC	This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?”
TTC	“Gentlemen!
TTC	“Is that all?”
TTC	I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
TTC	“That’s quartering,” said [NAME].
TTC	But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
TTC	He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.
TTC	As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of [NAME] I will do it!”
TTC	There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, [NAME] [NAME], and I see them--by the [NAME].”
TTC	“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the guard, in gruff [NAME].
TTC	Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of [NAME] [NAME]’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to [NAME] [NAME] that they were gone.
TTC	The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs.
TTC	He recovered himself so quickly, however, that [NAME] [NAME] had doubts of his business eye.
TTC	No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”
TTC	On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages of [NAME] yet stood.
TTC	My fault is, that I have been true to you.
TTC	“Thank you,” said the [NAME]--very sweetly indeed.
TTC	How near to her heart the echoes of her child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told.
TTC	“Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”
TTC	“Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] received him kindly, and so did [NAME].
TTC	The position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: “[NAME]! Spies!
TTC	I shall never feel her weight.”
TTC	To fail in submission to the authority of the [NAME] would be to put yourself out of [NAME].
TTC	As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “[NAME]-[NAME]!
TTC	Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?”
TTC	It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up.
TTC	“I dare say not,” rejoined [NAME], nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; “no matter, no matter.”
TTC	So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that [NAME] felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
TTC	“The chateau and all the race,” returned [NAME].
TTC	At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the [NAME] were coming.
TTC	“I don’t understand you,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	At this second interchange of the Christian name, [NAME] [NAME], still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
TTC	If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don’t_ understand him.
TTC	Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut.
TTC	The shining [NAME]’s [NAME] of the [NAME] was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets.
TTC	I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
TTC	The [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses.
TTC	Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a [NAME] room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on [NAME] [NAME] with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of [NAME] or [NAME].
TTC	“Do I date it?”
TTC	O sister-woman, think of me.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
TTC	Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of [NAME] [NAME], fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows.
TTC	He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had never been done.
TTC	“[NAME], father,” said [NAME], yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, “no.”
TTC	The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, [NAME] for joy.
TTC	“May I ask the cause?”
TTC	“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”
TTC	As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of [NAME]’s, after all these years, who ought to be?”
TTC	Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
TTC	“Did he run away, fellow?--where is that [NAME]?”
TTC	“Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”
TTC	“About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”
TTC	Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand.
TTC	It used not to be so, but [NAME] in all such things is changed for the worse.
TTC	But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!”  [NAME] and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
TTC	“Know that a petition was presented to the [NAME] and [NAME].
TTC	We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”
TTC	“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.
TTC	“Why, look at you all!”
TTC	The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.
TTC	I cry with vexation and disappointment!”
TTC	How did you come by it?
TTC	“‘[NAME],’ said I, ‘in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.’
TTC	“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the [NAME], in talking with [NAME], never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”
TTC	He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden.
TTC	And when, at the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight’s trip in [NAME], you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame.
TTC	“As I was prepared to hear, [NAME].”
TTC	I see one thing,” said [NAME].
TTC	exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.
TTC	Thus, [NAME] [NAME] in this vinous feature of his, until midday.
TTC	So far, we are not pursued.”
TTC	“If he’s found [NAME], you mean to say?”
TTC	“I am doubtful,” said [NAME] [NAME], hesitating and shaking his head, “about leaving of you, you see.
TTC	And hallo you!” said [NAME], more hoarsely than before.
TTC	You may as well go again me one way as another.
TTC	“Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her courage up?
TTC	“I try to be a good wife, [NAME],” the poor woman protested, with tears.
TTC	You have no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here [NAME] river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”
TTC	“It will be dark soon after four.
TTC	“This is the man.”
TTC	Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride’s hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of [NAME] [NAME]’s pockets.
TTC	This was [NAME] [NAME]’s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
TTC	“My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay.
TTC	“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”
TTC	“So soon?”
TTC	In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family.
TTC	A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
TTC	She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,  “I am going to see his Ghost!
TTC	Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before.
TTC	“A solitary old bachelor,” answered [NAME] [NAME], shaking his head.
TTC	The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it.
TTC	Pull ’em out, there!
TTC	He’d never have no good of it; he’d want all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in--even if it wos so.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when [NAME] [NAME] regained the blind.
TTC	He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thanks him.
TTC	Although the [NAME]’s daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics.
TTC	Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people’s blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be unavenged.
TTC	I admit that _
TTC	Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets.
TTC	A certain portion of his time was passed at [NAME], where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying [NAME] and [NAME] through the [NAME]-house.
TTC	They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little--listening perhaps.
TTC	O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!”
TTC	“Does he think me a ghost?”
TTC	That, the man sitting as [NAME] had then informed [NAME] [NAME] that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody.
TTC	[NAME] rejoining, “Nothing in life!”
TTC	There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight.
TTC	The [NAME]  One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of [NAME] [NAME] when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to imperil [NAME]’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the [NAME] roof.
TTC	In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart.
TTC	[NAME], less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.
TTC	If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you when you get back to [NAME].
TTC	“Do you know, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”
TTC	“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing.
TTC	I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
TTC	It is not a great deal, that!
TTC	Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road.
TTC	With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, [NAME] [NAME] shouldered himself into [NAME]-[NAME], amidst the general approbation of his hearers.
TTC	He wore an odd little sleek crisp [NAME] [NAME], setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
TTC	“Do you seek any promise from me?”
TTC	But what is the matter!
TTC	A brave number!
TTC	“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?”
TTC	He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone.
TTC	So oppressed, too--as you say.”
TTC	“Again, well?”
TTC	so-ho-then!”
TTC	Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?”
TTC	“And so do [NAME]
TTC	Even as it is--”  Even as it was, she could not command her voice.
TTC	We are all desperate here.
TTC	“My father!
TTC	If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face.
TTC	As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, [NAME] [NAME] said, still looking steadfastly in his face:  “[NAME] [NAME], do you remember nothing of me?”
TTC	“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think.
TTC	The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag.
TTC	My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having.
TTC	The entrance of the [NAME], and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue.
TTC	We are more afraid of you than of these others.”
TTC	Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers.
TTC	I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others.
TTC	Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
TTC	“Never mind about ‘happening,’ [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“You are right, [NAME],” was the response of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“That is the fact.”
TTC	“I never said it would.”
TTC	“Don’t be so terrified, my love.
TTC	when his face clears, as he looks into the third.
TTC	And [NAME] will be despatched in a wink, and she not here!
TTC	“But I do ask why?”
TTC	Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	His cursed life is not his own!”
TTC	The first was the best room, and in it were [NAME]’s birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and [NAME] of water-colours; the second was the [NAME]’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the [NAME]’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of [NAME] [NAME] in [NAME].
TTC	“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young [NAME] lady, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	“I hold another card, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out.
TTC	Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away.
TTC	Tell her that it was her husband’s last arrangement.
TTC	He lies here, in this corner of the carriage.
TTC	I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent.
TTC	“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried [NAME] [NAME], still wildly crying, “record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”
TTC	“With two companions.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in his wake, like a boat towed astern.
TTC	No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day.
TTC	Except that I remember them both to have been--like myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.”
TTC	“I think it necessary to turn the key.”
TTC	His head hanging over--like this!”
TTC	Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at [NAME]’s door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of [NAME], were put to Death.
TTC	“You have had your bottle, I perceive, [NAME].”
TTC	“It is more to the purpose that you say you are.”
TTC	“My dear [NAME] [NAME], it is because I am a [NAME] born, that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through my mind often.
TTC	He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room.
TTC	Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose.
TTC	I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel.
TTC	The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in [NAME] to The [NAME], whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, [NAME]!
TTC	Your preparations have been completed for some days, to return to [NAME].
TTC	About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.”
TTC	“Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”
TTC	Find out somebody.
TTC	“Now, I tell you where it is!” said [NAME] [NAME] to his wife, on entering.
TTC	“And take a pipe with you!”
TTC	I had the honour of being passed on the road.”
TTC	An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”
TTC	Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!”
TTC	Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the [NAME] was in use--to live by his own industry in [NAME], rather than on the industry of the overladen people of [NAME].
TTC	Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, [NAME] the [NAME] leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.
TTC	Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.
TTC	The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness.
TTC	Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this [NAME] of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, [NAME] [NAME] was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
TTC	But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently, though slowly.
TTC	“Many things.”
TTC	All the family!”
TTC	It is possible.
TTC	I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”
TTC	“I am quite sure, [NAME] [NAME],” returned [NAME] [NAME], “that you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”
TTC	I am not a traitor.”
TTC	These three young gentlemen, [NAME] [NAME], exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in [NAME], and had offered as pupils to [NAME]’s husband: delicately saying “[NAME]!
TTC	There are pen and ink and paper on this table.
TTC	The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them.
TTC	When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
TTC	“I _do_ know the [NAME].”
TTC	But, as an old fellow, who has carried [NAME] [NAME] in his arms, who is the trusted friend of [NAME] [NAME] and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken.
TTC	Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said [NAME], holding up his glass.
TTC	So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.
TTC	You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused?
TTC	Models of it were worn on breasts from which the [NAME] was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the [NAME] was denied.
TTC	The [NAME] took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
TTC	“On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
TTC	[NAME], and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of [NAME], it was not a time to yield to such emotions.
TTC	“Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said [NAME]; “say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”
TTC	What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her willing?’
TTC	I answer for my fellow-[NAME].”
TTC	With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall.
TTC	On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner.
TTC	Though the just [NAME] knows that I am innocent of any.
TTC	[NAME] has been arrested again.”
TTC	The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to [NAME] [NAME], tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”
TTC	The three went on, and [NAME] [NAME] went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road.
TTC	The [NAME] itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the [NAME] head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
TTC	“On the contrary; I come direct.”
TTC	Echoing [NAME]  A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the [NAME] lived.
TTC	I will not rest a moment.”
TTC	They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day.
TTC	Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison.
TTC	“Is there not?”
TTC	With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”
TTC	At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed.
TTC	“Will you wake me, before departing?
TTC	My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him.
TTC	Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on [NAME]!
TTC	While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way.
TTC	Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
TTC	The great majority were silent and still, looking fixedly at the ground.
TTC	That’s a very good card.
TTC	“The instruments of torture!”
TTC	They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full [NAME] flavour and blue-mould upon him.
TTC	As it passed, leaving [NAME] frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer’s [NAME], the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.
TTC	“O my father!”
TTC	The [NAME] road lay, as to him, beyond the [NAME] mail, as it lumbered up [NAME]’s [NAME].
TTC	“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, [NAME].”
TTC	My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many associations of the days when what we call the [NAME] was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”
TTC	You do remember them, I know.
TTC	“Courage, dear miss!
TTC	He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament.
TTC	That weapon was a gentleman’s.
TTC	She and no other.
TTC	But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of [NAME] [NAME] either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards [NAME] [NAME], the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	If you doubt it, ask [NAME], and he’ll tell you so.”
TTC	Nine, ten, eleven?”  “No matter, the number,” said [NAME].
TTC	“I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day.
TTC	He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.
TTC	I wish you would forget it.”
TTC	“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass.
TTC	“Are you going out?”
TTC	As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”
TTC	To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
TTC	“A moment!
TTC	I don’t know how scarce you mayn’t make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct.
TTC	There is no one in that room behind you!
TTC	[NAME], left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon.
TTC	Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of [NAME] wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
TTC	Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep.
TTC	“Now, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], whose eyes were red with felicity; “if you are ready, I am.”
TTC	“I don’t know that you ‘never will.’”
TTC	The other had that likeness too--as you have--but was not the same.
TTC	You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet.
TTC	An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets.
TTC	For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of [NAME] [NAME], almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have been anybody’s business, at the house of [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
TTC	Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside.
TTC	I didn’t quite mean what I said.”
TTC	“And before the tumbrils arrive.
TTC	They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the [NAME] itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
TTC	When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with [NAME] [NAME], the [NAME], and [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] [NAME] made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of [NAME] [NAME] as a problem of carelessness and recklessness.
TTC	I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way.
TTC	As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very [NAME], one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high.
TTC	Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in.
TTC	“[NAME] twenty years [NAME]”  “You do me too much honour,” said the [NAME]; “still, I prefer that supposition.”
TTC	wherein she was likewise much commended.
TTC	The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day.
TTC	I believe you.”
TTC	“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”
TTC	“The quartering one, eh?”  “Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.
TTC	It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival.
TTC	“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.
TTC	But it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife, it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”
TTC	While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them.
TTC	‘You will leave me them?
TTC	She was there, sitting beside her father.
TTC	“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer.
TTC	Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time.
TTC	But, the fierce figures were steadily wending [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME], be that as it would; and [NAME] [NAME], fire burned.
TTC	The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores.
TTC	“He must take his chance,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm’s way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one.
TTC	Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding [NAME]’s.
TTC	In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.”
TTC	I do you justice; I believe it.”
TTC	After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, [NAME] [NAME] flattened his flaxen [NAME] upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.
TTC	“May the [NAME] carry away these idiots!
TTC	Under the [NAME] sat [NAME] [NAME], in his usual quiet dress.
TTC	“I have observed his face!”
TTC	A moment, and it was gone.
TTC	[NAME] in [NAME]  [NAME], one of the great lords in power at the [NAME], held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in [NAME].
TTC	“I think so, too.”
TTC	When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart.
TTC	[NAME] was about to take his chocolate.
TTC	I wish to see her.”
TTC	The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
TTC	His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.
TTC	And went on sawing his wood.
TTC	Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”
TTC	At it again?”
TTC	That, he ([NAME] [NAME]-[NAME]) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his ([NAME] [NAME]-[NAME]’s) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his ([NAME] [NAME]-[NAME]’s) father and mother.
TTC	“‘[NAME] [NAME], formerly of [NAME],’ said the other; ‘the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in [NAME]?’
TTC	“I say a horse at a canter coming up, [NAME].”
TTC	The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive.
TTC	Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience.
TTC	The [NAME]  “Good day!” said [NAME] [NAME], looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.
TTC	His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.”
TTC	They were her husband’s words, as he held her to his bosom.
TTC	“You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place.
TTC	“Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”  “[NAME], it is true.”
TTC	“Surely it will release him!” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own.”
TTC	“I have no hope,” said [NAME] [NAME], in a low and sorrowful whisper.
TTC	She quickly brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
TTC	“As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], look upon the prisoner.”
TTC	“Yes, I could.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s fidelity of belief in [NAME] (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with [NAME] [NAME], and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
TTC	Give him that.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.
TTC	What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”
TTC	Devoutly thankful to [NAME] for his recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,” and turned to walk again.
TTC	These things were within [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine [NAME] afternoon.
TTC	Kiss him for me!”
TTC	Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction.
TTC	Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over [NAME], should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of [NAME] and [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME].
TTC	As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the [NAME].
TTC	If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, [NAME] [NAME] would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.
TTC	Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so [NAME] [NAME] inferred, from the circumstance of his holding [NAME] [NAME] by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed.
TTC	You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man’s opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.”
TTC	As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, [NAME] [NAME], after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage, remarked:  “I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”
TTC	The result of that conference was, that [NAME] again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.
TTC	Once more, the [NAME] mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side.
TTC	“If I might touch him!
TTC	We shall mount to a hundred soon.
TTC	Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o’clock in the afternoon.”
TTC	[NAME] gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning [NAME] one and indivisible of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or Death, [NAME]’s house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated.
TTC	“Pass this way, then.”
TTC	The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him be; let him be!
TTC	What a change you have made in yourself!
TTC	The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers.
TTC	As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”
TTC	It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it.
TTC	“Yesterday.
TTC	It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy’s kite without tail and wings.
TTC	If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!
TTC	I know it, and have heard my father say so.
TTC	They had all dropped off.
TTC	However, let me try.
TTC	“That’s true.
TTC	The [NAME] [NAME]  A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.
TTC	“To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority.
TTC	He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape.
TTC	What will I not promise to my Love?”
TTC	In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the forge?”
TTC	It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the [NAME] of the [NAME].
TTC	No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of [NAME] [NAME]: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.
TTC	O [NAME] [NAME], when the little picture of a happy father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”
TTC	“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”
TTC	“And what says he?
TTC	A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king’s palace to the criminal’s gaol.
TTC	“If the [NAME] should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her.
TTC	The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the [NAME] might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it.
TTC	You are a disagreeable fellow.”
TTC	She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
TTC	“The old [NAME] [NAME] of old [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the old seesaw [NAME].
TTC	And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone.
TTC	Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, [NAME] [NAME] hailed it with joy.
TTC	I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
TTC	“I think you have been drinking, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	It was now [NAME] [NAME]’s turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath.
TTC	From whom newly arrived, did he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms?
TTC	Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?”
TTC	As a tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young [NAME] [NAME] soon became known and encouraged.
TTC	I have said that he had reason to fear us.
TTC	“Apparently the [NAME]-[NAME] is not in his right mind?
TTC	They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs.
TTC	And yet there is not in [NAME], with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror.
TTC	“And I hope to do mine.
TTC	But, within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me.
TTC	“Arrested for all that.
TTC	“It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.”
TTC	Something of the awfulness, even of [NAME] itself, is referable to this.
TTC	asked [NAME], motioning to [NAME] [NAME] to come forward.
TTC	“Yes, sir.
TTC	A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only.
TTC	For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
TTC	Let us be clear-headed.
TTC	The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.”
TTC	Up the broad flight of shallow steps, [NAME] the [NAME], [NAME] preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees.
TTC	We seek him.
TTC	(Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.)
TTC	I mean to tell you, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even [NAME]’s should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.”
TTC	Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.
TTC	(Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.)
TTC	She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”
TTC	He dictated again.
TTC	[NAME] in the [NAME]  A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
TTC	The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
TTC	If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.
TTC	he muttered, at his own image; “why should you particularly like a man who resembles you?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] followed [NAME] to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation.
TTC	I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can’t find it.
TTC	“To-night?” said the mender of roads.
TTC	“Now your dinner is done,” [NAME] presently said, “why don’t you call a health, [NAME] [NAME]; why don’t you give your toast?”  “What health?
TTC	Knew no more about the lists?
TTC	“I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when [NAME] held them up.”
TTC	This in passing.
TTC	A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which [NAME] [NAME] had resolved!
TTC	“He happened to be the only one.”
TTC	It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account.”
TTC	Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; [NAME] [NAME] could have none.
TTC	“And why not?”  “[NAME] knows.
TTC	A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the [NAME].
TTC	He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire.
TTC	The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag.
TTC	He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance.
TTC	“Before I go,” he said, and [NAME] may kiss her?”
TTC	Light them, you!”
TTC	They were consigned to me, with him, at the--”
TTC	The [NAME] required the name of that citizen.
TTC	He, too, is pointed out.
TTC	the guard replied.
TTC	“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly.
TTC	You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast.
TTC	he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.
TTC	His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench.
TTC	“Why?” said [NAME].
TTC	“You didn’t mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact [NAME] [NAME], “and therefore how could you know it?
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] is the best authority possible, sir,” said [NAME], “and I have it from [NAME] [NAME]’s communication to a friend and brother [NAME] over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place.
TTC	Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration.
TTC	As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled [NAME] [NAME]’s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.
TTC	“‘If you remember,’” said [NAME], dictating, “‘the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
TTC	“Tell the Wind and the [NAME] where to stop; not me!”
TTC	I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.”
TTC	In this car of triumph, not even the [NAME]’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the [NAME].
TTC	He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim.
TTC	“I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence.
TTC	Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of [NAME]-[NAME], had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
TTC	In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
TTC	“‘I am a doctor, my poor fellow,’ said [NAME] ‘Let me examine it.’
TTC	Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”
TTC	“Everybody!” from all throats.
TTC	“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and between whom and you there is an impassable space.
TTC	It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while.
TTC	The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning.
TTC	“No one has told me so,” said [NAME], shaking his head.
TTC	The [NAME] having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the [NAME] adjourned.
TTC	Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air.
TTC	Thus [NAME] [NAME], with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] at home?”  Expected home.
TTC	“Good day, gentlemen!” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	said The [NAME], and embraced her.
TTC	“Am I to wait in the court, [NAME]?”
TTC	But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him.
TTC	His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face:  “Have you spoken to [NAME]?”
TTC	“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes!
TTC	He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”
TTC	But no matter; don’t stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own.
TTC	“I knew,” said [NAME], looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; “I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I was at that time in our [NAME] [NAME], and had been--oh! twenty years.”
TTC	He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him.
TTC	They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.’
TTC	Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, [NAME] sat down at the table.
TTC	“Extermination.”
TTC	I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the [NAME].
TTC	*****  “I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself.
TTC	“I am a [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], “I am desperate.
TTC	With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.
TTC	It being all spent, he said, rising:  “So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me.
TTC	But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it.
TTC	It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again.
TTC	But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and [NAME] [NAME] came down bringing his life with him for that while.
TTC	“You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no time to tell you.
TTC	“You approve?”
TTC	“Nothing to boast of,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
TTC	Look at him.
TTC	It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question.
TTC	But how do I know if he lies?
TTC	“I told you I would,” said [NAME] [NAME], “and I did.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”
TTC	It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed.
TTC	He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from [NAME] in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.
TTC	“And I have no doubt,” said [NAME] [NAME], “that I was right in the conversation we had.
TTC	But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.
TTC	you have been present all day, and you ought to know.
TTC	*****  “I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery.
TTC	Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, [NAME] [NAME] shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire.
TTC	Impassive faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “THOU DIDST IT!”
TTC	And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.
TTC	Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.
TTC	“My nephew,” said the [NAME], glancing at the supper preparation; “they said he was not arrived.”
TTC	Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!
TTC	Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure.
TTC	“Now what do you think, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: “what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?
TTC	The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.
TTC	Here, [NAME] [NAME] perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and [NAME] [NAME] rose and stepped forward.
TTC	She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.”
TTC	The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable.
TTC	No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.’
TTC	That head [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.
TTC	When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:  “Is [NAME] the topic?”
TTC	As well as the prisoner could see, he and [NAME] [NAME] were the only men there, unconnected with the [NAME], who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life.
TTC	repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear!
TTC	We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience.
TTC	The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out.
TTC	No direct answer could have been half so forcible.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] at home?”  Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of [NAME] [NAME], as to admission or denial of the fact.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], called [NAME], had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so.
TTC	To which it must be added that every new-comer from [NAME] reported himself and his tidings at [NAME]’s, almost as a matter of course.
TTC	This is that written paper.
TTC	He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling.
TTC	“Touching those signals, little citizen,” said [NAME] [NAME], sternly, “that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?”
TTC	“I have been to [NAME].”
TTC	He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried.
TTC	“And once again listen, [NAME]!” said the kneeling [NAME] [NAME]: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows.
TTC	“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of [NAME], to come here looking after her,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a [NAME] tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the [NAME],” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME], was made to stand and deliver on [NAME] [NAME], by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in [NAME] gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at [NAME] drawing-rooms; musketeers went into [NAME] [NAME]’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.
TTC	We have known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough?
TTC	He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.
TTC	That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from [NAME] by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in [NAME] that might impeach him for it.
TTC	Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant.
TTC	Lose no time!”
TTC	Many are under the displeasure of the [NAME], and must look out at the little window.
TTC	There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was.
TTC	Put some punch to it and smooth it again.”
TTC	“Who are the few?
TTC	I shall sink lower, and be worse.”
TTC	She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.
TTC	The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth.
TTC	[NAME] head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder.
TTC	“To return to poor [NAME],” said [NAME].
TTC	“I am the resurrection and the life, [NAME] the [NAME]: he that [NAME] in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] in me, shall never die.”
TTC	I may use that freedom with your name?”
TTC	I must act for myself, therefore.
TTC	[NAME] at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the [NAME] looked troubled, and listened attentively.
TTC	If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the [NAME]’s daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many.
TTC	“So far, [NAME] (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father.
TTC	“I was happy,” said [NAME] [NAME], “to be entrusted with the charge.
TTC	“I know that your intentions are evil,” said [NAME] [NAME], “and you may depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips.
TTC	“If you say eligible, you are eligible.”
TTC	“‘At last she is dead?’ said the elder, when I went in.
TTC	“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked [NAME] in a whisper.
TTC	“See you then, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], wrathfully; “and see you, too, my little [NAME]; see you both!
TTC	On the road I have suffered a great deal.
TTC	Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to [NAME]”  “When you were talking to [NAME],” [NAME] [NAME] repeated.
TTC	A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the [NAME]; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked.
TTC	Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in--a common dog, but sword in [NAME] is the loft window?
TTC	Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For the love of [NAME];” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour after [NAME] [NAME] could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
TTC	I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this.
TTC	He confirms me.
TTC	But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall.
TTC	It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the [NAME] were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness.
TTC	I am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.”
TTC	It was a take in.
TTC	Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you tell me!
TTC	As he looked at [NAME] with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, [NAME]--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.
TTC	We are pursued?
TTC	“We should look at this!”
TTC	It was [NAME]’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place, or space.
TTC	“Tell me when I ask you, not now.
TTC	The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and [NAME] had set it going.
TTC	Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.
TTC	But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the [NAME] in the face.
TTC	Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want!
TTC	He said not a word, however, and [NAME] [NAME], exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine.
TTC	Having released his noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from [NAME] [NAME], begged to ask him a few questions.
TTC	But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.
TTC	A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his.
TTC	[NAME] that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
TTC	He broke the awkward silence by saying:  “This is something new to me, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Certainly; and in these chambers.”
TTC	“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, “that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming.
TTC	Indeed it is so.
TTC	“[NAME], it is a cell.”
TTC	It will suit you to a marvel.”
TTC	Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists?
TTC	The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and failed him.
TTC	That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the [NAME]--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life and liberty.
TTC	I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
TTC	“Yes, I am.”
TTC	The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.
TTC	He turned into the [NAME], and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of [NAME]’s [NAME]-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the [NAME] chambers.
TTC	“If I had never seen [NAME], my father, I should have been quite happy with you.”
TTC	But even if not, even if I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I would--”  Then [NAME], with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.
TTC	When [NAME] [NAME] had again enfolded the [NAME] in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the [NAME]’s boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, [NAME] [NAME] spoke to her husband:  “Say then, my friend; what did [NAME] of the police tell thee?”
TTC	“And you are the better for it?”
TTC	Five paces by four and a half.”
TTC	“I can’t say that I mean to.
TTC	“Your fishing-rod gets [NAME] rusty; don’t it, father?”  “Never you mind.”
TTC	The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with [NAME].
TTC	Pay for your wine, and come out.
TTC	Therefore, all the [NAME] [NAME] doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
TTC	As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart.
TTC	“My child,” said the [NAME], rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, “I _have_ saved him.
TTC	Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged.
TTC	“[NAME], father!
TTC	It was so like [NAME]’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at [NAME]-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
TTC	Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!
TTC	“That’s business,” said [NAME] [NAME], resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”
TTC	At the back there.”
TTC	“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes.”
TTC	That?”  “Outside the blinds.
TTC	All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten.
TTC	“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk.
TTC	He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] knew [NAME] [NAME] to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.
TTC	They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.
TTC	“And I hear them!”
TTC	Its destination was the old church of [NAME] [NAME], far off in the fields.
TTC	The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.
TTC	“You dogs!” said the [NAME], but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth.
TTC	“Much to be regretted.
TTC	As to finances public, because [NAME] could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because [NAME]-[NAME] were rich, and [NAME], after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor.
TTC	After grasping the [NAME]’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of [NAME] [NAME], who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the [NAME]; after kissing little [NAME], who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful [NAME] who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.
TTC	Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men.
TTC	Such a heart [NAME] [NAME] carried under her rough robe.
TTC	*****  They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest man’s face ever beheld there.
TTC	No better man living to hold fast by what [NAME]’s had in keeping, and to hold his peace.
TTC	The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag.
TTC	“And that is--?”  “That she thinks he has.”
TTC	In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a cautious touch.
TTC	The [NAME] approached [NAME] [NAME], and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed?
TTC	As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.
TTC	The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in [NAME].
TTC	“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”
TTC	At midday, the roll of drums.
TTC	I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.
TTC	The eyes of [NAME] [NAME] were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.
TTC	“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father.
TTC	Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, [NAME] [NAME] bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him.
TTC	I think you were sent to me by [NAME].”
TTC	Will you render me a little help?”
TTC	(You will find a fine sea-coal fire, [NAME].)
TTC	Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for [NAME] [NAME], all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.
TTC	The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it.
TTC	exclaimed [NAME], with a bright flush.
TTC	On these few steps of his dangerous way, [NAME] [NAME] had set his foot according to [NAME] [NAME]’s reiterated instructions.
TTC	“I have done my best for you, [NAME] [NAME]; and my best is as good as another man’s, I believe.”
TTC	Now, get assistance and take me to the coach.”
TTC	Was he not an emigrant then?
TTC	Don’t be alarmed; I am not going to preach.”
TTC	Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even put the old man’s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then.
TTC	Sessions and [NAME] [NAME] had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] in the [NAME] of [NAME]’s [NAME], the florid countenance of [NAME] [NAME] might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
TTC	Soon, [NAME] [NAME]’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME]!” cries The [NAME], stamping her foot in the chair, “and here are the tumbrils!
TTC	Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there!
TTC	It’s hard enough to kill him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”
TTC	Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
TTC	The honoured parent steering [NAME], had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of [NAME] [NAME], and the two trudged on together.
TTC	Why not say so?
TTC	That fountain suggested the [NAME] fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”
TTC	“We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”
TTC	“You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said [NAME] [NAME], with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; “now, go home!”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] gone, like a shadow over the white road.
TTC	“Yes, madame, yes.
TTC	The [NAME] withdrew, and [NAME] seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands.
TTC	He called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.
TTC	As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither [NAME] nor her father must know of it until he was gone.
TTC	I demand to see her.
TTC	“A Doctor with a daughter.
TTC	The prisoner’s counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him.
TTC	I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“At sunset.”
TTC	He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.
TTC	I am, as you say, at a disadvantage.
TTC	“Do so, implicitly.
TTC	The worst of the strife was over.
TTC	“Then tell [NAME] and [NAME] where to stop,” returned madame; “but don’t tell me.”
TTC	“It’s enough for you,” retorted [NAME] [NAME], “to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn’t.
TTC	I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task.
TTC	There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
TTC	In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers.
TTC	When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him.
TTC	The [NAME]  [NAME]’s [NAME], established in the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME], was in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate.
TTC	Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the [NAME], forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed.
TTC	Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep.
TTC	Believe me, [NAME] [NAME], I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest.”
TTC	I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me.
TTC	The soldiers’ swords are sharpened there,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	She had not been married many weeks, when that man’s brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among us!
TTC	The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the [NAME] mail on that [NAME] night in [NAME] five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person.
TTC	Don’t you see she will fall!”
TTC	as if he had never heard of ubiquitous [NAME] in his time.
TTC	“All curious to see,” thought [NAME] [NAME], in his amiably shrewd way, “but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn’t be in better hands.”
TTC	“So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the [NAME]’s chair, “even of this distress.”
TTC	“Let it be read.”
TTC	Before that unjust [NAME], there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.
TTC	Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”  “Listen then, [NAME],” Number One of that name sternly interposed.
TTC	In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that [NAME] [NAME] determined to have the aid he sought.
TTC	He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler’s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.
TTC	The [NAME] was in his best condition, and looked specially young.
TTC	returned the mender of roads, with extended finger.
TTC	True, but not an English woman.
TTC	Six tumbrils roll along the streets.
TTC	For, I am not a bad witness.”
TTC	“Yes, thank you.”
TTC	Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning.
TTC	He regretted that [NAME] was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], what was there to dismiss!
TTC	The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
TTC	The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
TTC	[NAME] stopped short, and stared at him.
TTC	The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
TTC	“I will remember them.
TTC	He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”
TTC	“Drop it then,” said [NAME] [NAME]; “I won’t have none of _your_
TTC	“Come, then!
TTC	I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be _his_ vassal.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s olfactory sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed.
TTC	I am sure it does no good.
TTC	The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but [NAME]’s hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and [NAME]’s left arm caught him round the waist.
TTC	You don’t know the value of money, you live hard, you’ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse.”
TTC	It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in action--not in words.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time.
TTC	The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses.
TTC	“One can depart, citizen?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call.
TTC	During all that time [NAME] was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the [NAME] would strike off her husband’s head next day.
TTC	As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, [NAME] had a swamped life of it.
TTC	I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to no one else.
TTC	“[NAME], I looked at the man.”
TTC	“Who has seen her?
TTC	The [NAME], husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of [NAME] whereunto their journey naturally tended.
TTC	But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”
TTC	I mock you.”
TTC	“Long ago.”
TTC	When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the [NAME]’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.
TTC	My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good [NAME] and a bold man; he has deserved well of the [NAME], and possesses its confidence.
TTC	She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.
TTC	The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.
TTC	“It is very high; it is a little difficult.
TTC	“Speak for yourself, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME]; “I have a night’s work to do yet.
TTC	“The pleasure of conversing with you, [NAME] [NAME], recalls to me,”  pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name.”
TTC	That, this patriot would be produced before them.
TTC	The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.
TTC	They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it.
TTC	“Well; he may be.”
TTC	“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.
TTC	“You see?” said [NAME], looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your hazard very great?”
TTC	“Touch that string, and he instantly changes for the worse.
TTC	no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens!
TTC	“A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up.
TTC	Go you in alone; I wait near.
TTC	Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four o’clock.
TTC	“You shall know directly.
TTC	Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered.
TTC	There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.
TTC	The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night.
TTC	Give me my work.”
TTC	From his oppressed slumber, [NAME] [NAME] in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room.
TTC	Unseen by the spy, [NAME] [NAME] stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.
TTC	When they took a young man into [NAME]’s [NAME] house, they hid him somewhere till he was old.
TTC	He is dead.”
TTC	“Thérèse.”  “[NAME],” the woman recommends.
TTC	“Which is [NAME]?” says a man behind him.
TTC	His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
TTC	If it had been otherwise;’” the hand was at the prisoner’s face; “‘I should but have had so much the more to answer for.
TTC	Here is the letter.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache.
TTC	[NAME] on the way out of court not being allowed, [NAME] heard no more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.
TTC	“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said [NAME], shaking his head.
TTC	She and [NAME] had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that [NAME] brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as [NAME] [NAME], taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.
TTC	“‘She is my sister, [NAME].
TTC	Having thus given his parent [NAME] speed, young [NAME] seated himself on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated.
TTC	The [NAME] turned his eyes upon that man.
TTC	I must look in at [NAME]’s; so I will go there at once and come back presently.
TTC	The [NAME]  It was the [NAME] road that lay, on a [NAME] night late in [NAME], before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
TTC	What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”
TTC	Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently, that if [NAME] [NAME] had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two.
TTC	He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.
TTC	That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.”
TTC	O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife!
TTC	I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such great things as this.
TTC	No motives but motives of sheer patriotism?
TTC	“[NAME], my dear [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], as he raised her.
TTC	[NAME] was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the [NAME] of [NAME] to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without.
TTC	Two or three times.
TTC	“I do seek that.”
TTC	As it pleased [NAME] in its mercy to restore him so soon, I should have great hope.
TTC	You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say.”
TTC	“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.
TTC	It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation.
TTC	“[NAME]! Well,” returned [NAME] [NAME], going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”
TTC	The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at [NAME] the [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME] is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile.
TTC	It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his.
TTC	Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road?
TTC	“Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious [NAME] [NAME]; “you’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman.
TTC	“Indeed, my own?
TTC	After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better of it.
TTC	The supposed [NAME] descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him.
TTC	“It will seem nothing to you.
TTC	“Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without.
TTC	His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame.
TTC	At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like [NAME] [NAME]; but now, everything is stopped.”
TTC	Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips.
TTC	“I think, [NAME], poor [NAME] [NAME] deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night.”
TTC	It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious.
TTC	Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the rage and discontent to which the [NAME] addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour.
TTC	The same [NAME], with the same luck.
TTC	One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people’s altar.
TTC	What prison is he in?”  “[NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	“[NAME] dear!”
TTC	“But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case.
TTC	“Your clemency, [NAME]!
TTC	I trust, and I almost believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”
TTC	The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
TTC	How do you choose them?”
TTC	She doesn’t notice a word!
TTC	“It is necessary to register him.
TTC	Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into [NAME] while he was yet on [NAME] [NAME]’s side of [NAME] [NAME], bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was.
TTC	“[NAME], [NAME] the [NAME]!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is a child.”
TTC	“What did you say?”
TTC	He had been some few leagues behind [NAME], early in the afternoon.
TTC	“I have seen you somewhere.”
TTC	They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
TTC	“I’ll walk with you to her gate.
TTC	But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of indifference.
TTC	There was no variation in the order, or the manner.
TTC	I feel certain of it.
TTC	You have seen him at work?”
TTC	“If you were to go before,” said [NAME] [NAME], “and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn’t that be best?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a [NAME] journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like [NAME]!”
TTC	“But I would hold a pretty wager, [NAME], that a [NAME] like [NAME] and [NAME] was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?”
TTC	“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him.
TTC	he said deferentially.
TTC	Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust.
TTC	And it’s really very hard,”  said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“‘There is prodigious strength,’ I answered him, ‘in sorrow and despair.’
TTC	Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.
TTC	“That has a bad look,” said Darnay--  “A bad look, you say, my dear [NAME]?
TTC	“It is the same.
TTC	“Into the court, [NAME]?”  “Into the court.”
TTC	In the arrangements of the little household, [NAME] [NAME] took charge of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously.
TTC	She was absolutely without pity.
TTC	“I know it well,” answered [NAME].
TTC	Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, [NAME] affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the [NAME] of [NAME].
TTC	“Who?” demanded the traveller.
TTC	Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise.
TTC	“Very good.
TTC	“Really, is bad enough,” returned [NAME] [NAME], “but better.
TTC	The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
TTC	the chemist whistled softly, as he read it.
TTC	The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the [NAME], as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions put to you, and make no remark upon them.”
TTC	In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.
TTC	“Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”
TTC	We may go.”
TTC	By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations.
TTC	He was fast asleep directly.
TTC	“Though it’s not important,” repeated [NAME], in the same mechanical way--“though
TTC	“The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”
TTC	“‘Now, lift me up, [NAME]; lift me up.
TTC	Will you hear me?”
TTC	The [NAME] bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the [NAME] [NAME], that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it.
TTC	Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after.
TTC	“I assure you,” returned [NAME] [NAME], in the friendliest way, “that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s account.
TTC	“Yes?” said [NAME].
TTC	“I wonder,” said [NAME] [NAME], pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!”
TTC	This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.
TTC	As I was [NAME]”  Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:
TTC	“What is that noise?” said the [NAME], turning towards the window.
TTC	“He would count as one head,” observed [NAME] [NAME], in a low voice.
TTC	In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of [NAME] that sparkled in his sight.
TTC	“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said [NAME].
TTC	It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.
TTC	From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the [NAME]’s door.
TTC	It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.
TTC	“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?
TTC	Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips.
TTC	His mother had died, years before.
TTC	“[NAME], hear me!
TTC	“At another time, [NAME],” he returned, evasively, “the present time is ill-conwenient for [NAME]’.
TTC	“Good night!” said the uncle.
TTC	The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”
TTC	How do you call the man?
TTC	“For to-morrow!”
TTC	They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls.
TTC	They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell.
TTC	This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened [NAME] [NAME]’s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.
TTC	A favourite at the [NAME] [NAME], and eke at the [NAME], [NAME] [NAME] had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted.
TTC	He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger.
TTC	Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone.
TTC	“Well?”  “[NAME], there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”
TTC	I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten years’ time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.
TTC	In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and its going.
TTC	My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother’s, is not, as you will remember, my own.
TTC	But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away.
TTC	I do not think,” said [NAME] [NAME] with the firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of association would renew it.
TTC	Firstly, because, on fine [NAME], he often walked out, before dinner, with the [NAME] and [NAME]; secondly, because, on unfavourable [NAME], he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the [NAME]’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.
TTC	“You are still hard at work, I see?”
TTC	Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the [NAME] de [NAME] for judgment.
TTC	The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom.
TTC	The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed in:  “One hundred and five, [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?”
TTC	I was not.
TTC	[NAME]-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!”
TTC	There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees.
TTC	“Is this the emigrant [NAME]?”
TTC	In the first fright and horror of her situation, [NAME] [NAME] passed the body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help.
TTC	Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike.
TTC	“And do you take no one with you?”
TTC	“No!” returned the spy.
TTC	I say, stop there.”
TTC	“Good night, citizen,” said [NAME] [NAME], pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively.
TTC	He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner’s desk.
TTC	“It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
TTC	[NAME] the [NAME] cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before [NAME] of the [NAME]--only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.
TTC	It won’t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”
TTC	“It is, that if [NAME] [NAME] should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it.
TTC	“See the old villain bound with ropes.
TTC	I_ think for others?
TTC	To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling.
TTC	“No games to-morrow!
TTC	“I shall be there before the commencement.”
TTC	“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.
TTC	“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, [NAME]
TTC	“It is so,” assented [NAME].
TTC	“Now, to the prisoner’s conversation, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me.
TTC	Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”
TTC	A blush on the countenance of [NAME] the [NAME] was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting sun.
TTC	I am well, and your father has  influence around me.
TTC	The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect.
TTC	There was a character about [NAME] [NAME], from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided.
TTC	And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.
TTC	“But never by me, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
TTC	When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept [NAME]’s proposal to retire and live at my ease.
TTC	There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!”
TTC	In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, [NAME] [NAME] resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so.
TTC	He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger.
TTC	Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”
TTC	She was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.
TTC	“He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had not moved from the spot where she stood when [NAME] [NAME] first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.
TTC	I ask for information, as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea?
TTC	The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.
TTC	It was the incident of every day, and the society of [NAME] [NAME] were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening.
TTC	The shadow attendant on [NAME] [NAME] and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
TTC	Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
TTC	“It comes slowly.”
TTC	He moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice,  “‘Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited.
TTC	Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave.
TTC	That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.
TTC	In short, must leave it alone, like or no like.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], be tranquil.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he could find.
TTC	Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together.
TTC	The [NAME], as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the [NAME] fell, or old [NAME] was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in [NAME] [NAME]’s bosom.  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I am in my seventy-eighth year.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of [NAME] had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint’s mercies.
TTC	The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was [NAME] [NAME], already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.
TTC	“Children?”  “No children.”
TTC	Will you please to enter the carriage?’
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] of day!
TTC	As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly.
TTC	“You are a luckier, if you mean that.”
TTC	“Indeed?”  “Ah[NAME] indeed!” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] has quite departed from my breast.
TTC	“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered [NAME] [NAME], with meekness; “how are you?”
TTC	No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him.
TTC	Happily, however, there was sleep in [NAME] that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
TTC	[NAME] having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the [NAME] of [NAME] to be thrown open, and issued forth.
TTC	“Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me.
TTC	First,” he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city.
TTC	“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun.
TTC	A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of [NAME], was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
TTC	Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business?
TTC	The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
TTC	Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, [NAME] [NAME] did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the [NAME], that were not yet made.
TTC	“[NAME] of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.”
TTC	And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.”
TTC	You are going to her, I hope?
TTC	He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage--our dog-[NAME], as that man would call it.
TTC	It was a profounder remark than [NAME] [NAME] had looked for.
TTC	Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, [NAME] [NAME] dropped off to sleep.
TTC	“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”  observed [NAME].
TTC	Reaccused and retaken yesterday.
TTC	The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid.
TTC	The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter.
TTC	They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, [NAME] [NAME], and [NAME] [NAME]--to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother [NAME] should have been the bridegroom.
TTC	“‘She has some recent association with the number twelve?’
TTC	“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose.
TTC	cried the smith.
TTC	I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in [NAME].”
TTC	This done, he went on direct to [NAME]’s, and went in.
TTC	Yes, he had.
TTC	After some mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before [NAME] [NAME], or in the little [NAME] vacation between it and [NAME].
TTC	“Why not?”
TTC	The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
TTC	“I have delivered that letter,” said [NAME] [NAME] to [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:  “What is this?”
TTC	You can bear it?”
TTC	But they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in.
TTC	“You think so?” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both.
TTC	“You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”
TTC	He had heard of [NAME], at the posting-houses, as being before him.
TTC	In going, he had to face [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“How, then!
TTC	Wishing you were going to [NAME] at this time of day!”
TTC	A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
TTC	“You know me, my dear friend?
TTC	Always the same with you people.
TTC	To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
TTC	Why need I speak of my father’s time, when it is equally yours?
TTC	“If it is?” repeated his wife.
TTC	Less than two pipes.
TTC	“But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said [NAME] [NAME], rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to [NAME]”  “I understand.
TTC	Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine.
TTC	In the shadow of [NAME] and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
TTC	and they went down into the courtyard.
TTC	It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red.
TTC	He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one.
TTC	Better leave it alone.
TTC	“We are already friends, I hope.”
TTC	It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier!
TTC	What would you have me do, my Life?”
TTC	“You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected.
TTC	Still [NAME]  [NAME] [NAME] and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of [NAME] [NAME], while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of [NAME] the [NAME], now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees.
TTC	In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near [NAME] [NAME]’s counter.
TTC	He left his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and no sooner; took horse for [NAME]; and began his journey.
TTC	“‘She has a husband, a father, and a brother?’
TTC	They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], surely!” said [NAME] [NAME], who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.
TTC	Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear.
TTC	My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end.
TTC	The table trembled in the silence that followed.
TTC	Listen to what is to follow.
TTC	There’s the roll of them dreadful carts!
TTC	“They did.”
TTC	“Thank [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], clasping his hands, “that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night.
TTC	A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.
TTC	You may tell him so, with my compliments.
TTC	It was almost dark when they arrived at the [NAME].
TTC	I think so.
TTC	The least thing--nothing--startles you!
TTC	“My wife,” said [NAME] aloud, addressing [NAME] [NAME]: “I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called [NAME].
TTC	He faltered for an instant; then went on as before.
TTC	“They are here.
TTC	Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the [NAME]; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply.
TTC	[NAME] glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence.
TTC	That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction.
TTC	It is better as it is.”
TTC	“_I_ think it is well.”
TTC	My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Recalled to [NAME];’ which may mean anything.
TTC	It can’t be.
TTC	Might have been.
TTC	Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking [NAME] [NAME] in it had much engaged [NAME] [NAME]’s attention.
TTC	Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind.
TTC	Now, it is of no use asking too much of me.
TTC	A moment of profound silence followed.
TTC	Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there.
TTC	Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the [NAME], and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.
TTC	“Here’s a man of business--a man of years--a man of [NAME]_ a [NAME],” said [NAME]; “and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says there’s no reason at all!
TTC	Rather wishing his modest adjective away, [NAME] [NAME] replied, “No, no, no.
TTC	It was almost morning, when [NAME]’s wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers, and [NAME] [NAME] said to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door:
TTC	It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page.
TTC	At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time.
TTC	“But my dear!” began [NAME].
TTC	It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind.
TTC	I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”
TTC	Then [NAME] [NAME] turned and burst out of the [NAME], causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks.
TTC	“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it depended on [NAME]--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this man even now.”
TTC	“I mean,” said [NAME] [NAME], “that he warn’t never in it.
TTC	Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	It would be dangerous for [NAME] yet.”
TTC	The joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out.
TTC	Could a repetition of it be prevented?
TTC	I am almost sure it was you.”
TTC	And these here would be mine, if it wos so, [NAME]’ of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep’ it back.”
TTC	“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children.
TTC	Don’t ask, why, in these times.”
TTC	This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows [NAME] [NAME], I will invite him to [NAME] [NAME]’s with us.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], called [NAME], in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in [NAME].
TTC	The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:  “He is accused by [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	“I do ask it.
TTC	With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
TTC	“Pray let there be no mistake about it.”
TTC	I won’t have my wittles blest off my table.
TTC	Let him eat it now!”
TTC	These occupations brought her round to the [NAME] month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head.
TTC	I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”
TTC	Look at your boy: he _is_ [NAME], ain’t he?
TTC	She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed.
TTC	Her hope had been to avert the wrath of [NAME] from a [NAME] that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
TTC	“Can it be true,” said [NAME], in a low voice, looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has said of [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	“Will you tell me who denounced him?”
TTC	“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.”
TTC	Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!”
TTC	“You will not swear, [NAME] [NAME], that he was not one of them?”
TTC	The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put [NAME] [NAME]’s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; [NAME] [NAME]’s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn.
TTC	However, father and daughter did at last appear, and [NAME] [NAME] was ready at the street door to receive them.
TTC	“Then you mean to tell me, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], squaring his elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?”
TTC	What did he live upon?
TTC	But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts.
TTC	What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
TTC	His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart.
TTC	I am going to.
TTC	Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it.
TTC	“Good night, citizen.”
TTC	Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.
TTC	“You know where to deliver it?”
TTC	“The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my father.
TTC	The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.
TTC	Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
TTC	I get on.”
TTC	May one ask what it is for?”
TTC	“I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing--since she was ten years old.
TTC	The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets.
TTC	Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the [NAME] were left together, [NAME] [NAME] said, feelingly:
TTC	Yes, I am very much put out.”
TTC	croaked [NAME] [NAME], who had come close up.
TTC	Don’t be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank.
TTC	“Ye-[NAME], sir,” returned [NAME], in something of a dogged manner.
TTC	But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me?
TTC	He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence.
TTC	So much the worse!
TTC	“The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, ‘There is a case of medicines here;’ and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table.
TTC	As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating.
TTC	Possibly you have heard of me.”
TTC	“Yes, citizen.”
TTC	Certain small packets were made and given to him.
TTC	“And so,” said [NAME] [NAME], who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet [NAME], that I brought you across the [NAME], such a baby!
TTC	The [NAME] knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
TTC	The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber.
TTC	“After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to [NAME].
TTC	It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?”
TTC	Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea.
TTC	“[NAME] if I know,” said [NAME].
TTC	Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me.
TTC	He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe.
TTC	The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”
TTC	The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty.
TTC	In a moment, the whole company were on their feet.
TTC	Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified [NAME] [NAME], that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father’s.
TTC	In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned.
TTC	And off _its_ head comes.
TTC	I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be.”
TTC	In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the [NAME] [NAME] removed him from all other men.
TTC	I was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed.
TTC	“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls.
TTC	In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the [NAME] preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.
TTC	Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough.
TTC	“But our [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], “is undoubtedly a good [NAME]?
TTC	Where is he?’
TTC	“Kiss me, child of [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the [NAME]?”
TTC	There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, [NAME] [NAME] hacked the shoemaker’s bench to pieces, while [NAME] [NAME] held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure.
TTC	The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want.
TTC	The precious child is safe in bed?”
TTC	After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, “Yes--I am working.”
TTC	“Of what trade?”  “[NAME] the [NAME], vendor of wine.”  “Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the [NAME], throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will.
TTC	She was a golden-haired doll!”
TTC	After several relapses into business-absorption, [NAME] [NAME] had become the [NAME]’s friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
TTC	The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days.
TTC	He was well acquainted, more-over, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
TTC	The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac.
TTC	The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and [NAME] [NAME] had got him!
TTC	More than that,” he added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, [NAME], seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.”
TTC	For some months past, [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket.
TTC	“Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”
TTC	“From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber.
TTC	At the instant when [NAME] saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse’s flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates.
TTC	Take my arm, sir.”
TTC	If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him.
TTC	“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!”
TTC	Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together.
TTC	There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and [NAME] [NAME] wept over her.
TTC	His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment.
TTC	That, [NAME], as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
TTC	They both entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps.
TTC	Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!”
TTC	The night comes on dark.
TTC	[NAME], a petition.”
TTC	With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away.
TTC	Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.”
TTC	“The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed.
TTC	When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of [NAME], the shoemaker looked up.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at [NAME] [NAME] shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
TTC	“[NAME], [NAME], no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.
TTC	“Is there any noise in the streets?”
TTC	“Any time mentioned?”
TTC	A few minutes brought them to [NAME] [NAME]’s destination.
TTC	Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.
TTC	Sustain yourself without that.
TTC	He had not put them there first.
TTC	Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his own.
TTC	I come from her--your wife, dear [NAME].”
TTC	A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill.
TTC	“Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair.
TTC	“What vapour is that?”
TTC	“Indeed?”  “For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll fidget me to death,” said [NAME] [NAME]: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness.
TTC	I know you are true.”
TTC	He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
TTC	“Lift him, and come away!”
TTC	“Take you my knitting,” said [NAME] [NAME], placing it in her lieutenant’s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat.
TTC	“O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”  “[NAME]!
TTC	Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that [NAME] [NAME] saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
TTC	Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing known to the fashion.
TTC	As I intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed.
TTC	“‘Gentlemen,’ said I, ‘pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.’
TTC	“Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart.
TTC	For which reason, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that word, to save my life.”
TTC	In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment.
TTC	He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.
TTC	These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.
TTC	Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
TTC	The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], turning to his offspring, “it’s a [NAME]’.”
TTC	exclaimed the man with the bloated face.
TTC	“So much the better.
TTC	he added again, after a peal of thunder.
TTC	“I don’t mean that.
TTC	A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.
TTC	“I understand the feeling!”
TTC	“Don’t you be afraid of that.”
TTC	What did he call himself?
TTC	He found the [NAME] reading in his arm-chair at a window.
TTC	It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”
TTC	Give him to drink, my wife!”
TTC	It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it.”
TTC	“You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.”
TTC	In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”
TTC	It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year.
TTC	Again: [NAME]’s was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate.
TTC	She will do very well.
TTC	Almost at the first word, [NAME] [NAME] started and became deeply attentive.
TTC	“I’ve seen him.
TTC	“To the first, then.
TTC	They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for [NAME], always do.
TTC	Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, [NAME] heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds.
TTC	I left him climbing to the window, and I came to tell you.
TTC	The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:  “I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day.
TTC	The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after.
TTC	The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something.
TTC	“Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued [NAME] [NAME], “even if it wos so, which I don’t say it [NAME]”  “Don’t prevaricate,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.
TTC	“Yes!”  “Be explicit,” said the [NAME].
TTC	“And all I can say of it is,” laughed [NAME] with a vexed laugh, “that this--ha, [NAME] everything past, present, and to come.”
TTC	After trying it, [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], was satisfied that no plainer case could be.
TTC	Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.
TTC	It is not in your nature to forget them.’”
TTC	“Fashion of speech again!
TTC	He had been days upon his journey in [NAME] alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from [NAME].
TTC	“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy.
TTC	I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if it wasn’t for the pain in ’em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I’m none the better for it in pocket; and it’s my suspicion that you’ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket, and I won’t put up with it, [NAME], and what do you say now!”
TTC	But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.
TTC	Every eye was turned to the jury.
TTC	They fished with a spade, at first.
TTC	There were few buildings then, north of the [NAME]-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields.
TTC	“What’s that?”
TTC	If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
TTC	“It is a lady’s shoe.
TTC	I never saw the mode.
TTC	It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a particular occasion.
TTC	At length, on [NAME] night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
TTC	He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished.
TTC	The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing shadow.
TTC	“Yes, sir.”
TTC	The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
TTC	Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] [NAME], are you a clerk in [NAME]’s bank?”
TTC	“Where?”  “Here.”
TTC	“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--[NAME]--of the bank of [NAME] and Company--over to [NAME].”
TTC	This answer had a happy effect upon the audience.
TTC	“Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it’s not important.”
TTC	“I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”
TTC	Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?”
TTC	Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company--at the office of [NAME]’s [NAME], for instance?”
TTC	Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction.
TTC	At two-thirds of a league from the [NAME]--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house.
TTC	“I passed you on the road?”
TTC	It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
TTC	“Show me!”
TTC	The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
TTC	No business of anybody’s.
TTC	“Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box, with my name on the outside.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
TTC	“I don’t suppose anything about it but what [NAME] tells me.”
TTC	Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-[NAME] in his hand.
TTC	So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.
TTC	Can I spare this Doctor to my husband?
TTC	The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.
TTC	*****  “The carriage left the streets behind, passed the [NAME] [NAME], and emerged upon the country road.
TTC	Who could that be with [NAME] [NAME]--the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair--who must not be seen?
TTC	“[NAME], ha!”
TTC	They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening:  “My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which [NAME] can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon.
TTC	He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man.”
TTC	The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing.
TTC	she cried, pointing him out.
TTC	The official turned towards him with sudden distrust.
TTC	With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.
TTC	“Very well.
TTC	This citizen,” pointing out the second who had entered, “is from [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	“It is so,” assented [NAME] once more.
TTC	repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer.
TTC	“I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me.
TTC	“I thought, my father,” said [NAME], excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”
TTC	You’re religious, too.
TTC	She stood, like a spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.
TTC	The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now turned again, stood up where she had sat.
TTC	Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within.
TTC	This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.
TTC	“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket.
TTC	Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing.
TTC	He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which [NAME] [NAME] had hired in honour of the day.
TTC	Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off.
TTC	“My dear [NAME], if he were overworked now--”  “My dear [NAME], I doubt if that could easily be.
TTC	To go on--”
TTC	Greater things than the [NAME] had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose.
TTC	Then, the miserable bakers’ shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip.
TTC	We are quite a [NAME] [NAME], as well as an English one.”
TTC	“How is the young lady?”  “She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court.”
TTC	Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
TTC	As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him.
TTC	If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!”
TTC	Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers.
TTC	Don’t go and tell me that you buried [NAME].
TTC	“Is that all, [NAME]?”  “That’s all.
TTC	There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way:  “[NAME], then, my [NAME], what do you do there?”
TTC	The [NAME] took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?
TTC	A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when [NAME] [NAME] began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at [NAME].
TTC	The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end.
TTC	I never thought this of him.”
TTC	Dear, dear, dear!
TTC	[NAME], [NAME], much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee.
TTC	These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.
TTC	Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame.
TTC	The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance.
TTC	They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely [NAME] the box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the [NAME].
TTC	“Yes, I do.”
TTC	No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.
TTC	Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent.
TTC	He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but [NAME] [NAME] did not come back.
TTC	Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at [NAME]’s, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely.
TTC	When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out.
TTC	You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are [NAME] and [NAME] in the world you must not delay.”
TTC	“Not much boiling down to be done to-night, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], gaily, as he looked among his papers.
TTC	The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time.
TTC	I will never refer to it again.
TTC	It struck him motionless.
TTC	What has brought you here?
TTC	I address myself to that Doctor.”
TTC	Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they thought as much at [NAME] that sunny summer day.
TTC	“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose?
TTC	the spy irresolutely asked.
TTC	He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there.
TTC	“Thank you.
TTC	And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, [NAME].
TTC	Which of the two goes first?
TTC	He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen.
TTC	his wife implored.
TTC	[NAME] would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.
TTC	he said, with a start.
TTC	“And now,” said [NAME] [NAME], shaking his forensic forefinger at the [NAME] in general, when it was down, “my way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”
TTC	“The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name.
TTC	It was a bit of the art of an [NAME] [NAME] tactician, in which he found great relief.
TTC	“Well then, I’ll tell you,” said [NAME], coming slowly into a sitting posture.
TTC	“It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did it, in the second.
TTC	There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at [NAME]’s who shook hands with a customer when the [NAME] pervaded the air.
TTC	My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], with a terrified face, was at his ear.
TTC	“Before [NAME], and at [NAME], and ever since [NAME],”  pursued [NAME], “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine.
TTC	The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes.
TTC	So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.
TTC	He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only [NAME] [NAME] in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
TTC	The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.
TTC	The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.
TTC	For an instant, the [NAME] even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on [NAME]’s lips.
TTC	And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.”
TTC	Nothing would induce him to speak more.
TTC	“But I do, and you must take my word for it.
TTC	“Was he a spy?” asked [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,”  said the spy, firmly.
TTC	That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the [NAME], had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that [NAME] of Blood until the danger was over.
TTC	Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap.
TTC	There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.
TTC	It is only a question of a few hours.
TTC	“_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
TTC	She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two.
TTC	What are you worth!
TTC	“It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary.
TTC	“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
TTC	“It brought me here, it brought me to my grave.
TTC	“I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night.
TTC	But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time.
TTC	All the devouring and insatiate [NAME] imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, [NAME].
TTC	You will only die with me.
TTC	The two spectators started forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand.
TTC	Monseigneur, hear my petition!
TTC	No. Expect to get anything by this evidence?
TTC	I could go to [NAME] in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”
TTC	People are so unreasonable!
TTC	You hate the fellow.”
TTC	In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?”
TTC	At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers.
TTC	I told her not to come near us till he was dead.
TTC	It’s a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.
TTC	And it was done--why, how old are you?”
TTC	But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress.
TTC	Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?”
TTC	He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause:  “Will you answer his question to me then?
TTC	“DEAREST,--Take courage.
TTC	The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?”
TTC	Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all.
TTC	The best and the worst are known to you, now.
TTC	“I want,” said [NAME], who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, “to let in a little more light here.
TTC	“It is enough, my husband,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], look once more upon the prisoner.
TTC	Now, from the days when it was always summer in [NAME], to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--[NAME] [NAME]’s way--the way of the love of a woman.
TTC	Those were the words I said.
TTC	Ever live by cheating at play?
TTC	The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief.
TTC	You are summoned for to-morrow.”
TTC	Suspected and [NAME] enemy of the [NAME], [NAME], one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people.
TTC	“Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself?
TTC	“You can be when you choose?”
TTC	“Of course.”
TTC	The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife.
TTC	After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the [NAME] editor, they resumed their conversation.
TTC	It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that [NAME] [NAME] observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.
TTC	I shall fire!”
TTC	Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform the society--in secret.”
TTC	The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.
TTC	“That’s well.
TTC	Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived.
TTC	The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with [NAME] [NAME], he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.
TTC	All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”
TTC	Give me your authority, like a dear good man.
TTC	Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too.
TTC	Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring [NAME], and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop.
TTC	Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air.
TTC	Is it his child?”  “Excuse me, [NAME] the [NAME]--it is a pity--yes.”
TTC	That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left [NAME], he of course knew now.
TTC	Who is she?”
TTC	“My dear,” said [NAME] [NAME], striking in to explain; “there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, [NAME] [NAME] wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them.
TTC	I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine.
TTC	Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape.”
TTC	“I said, ‘I have seen her.’
TTC	But, not for long.
TTC	One more pull and you’re at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!”
TTC	This touched [NAME] [NAME] on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.
TTC	“Not at all!”
TTC	But, such awful workers, and such awful work!
TTC	“He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them.
TTC	“He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on [NAME]’s part.
TTC	“Shall I go on, sir?”
TTC	There was a change in the appearance of [NAME] [NAME]; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.
TTC	“Who seeks him?” answered [NAME].
TTC	“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced to the [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Give me your arm, my love.
TTC	I must finish my record to-day.
TTC	She is yours!”
TTC	[NAME], shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”
TTC	It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of [NAME] the [NAME], for whom [NAME] was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present [NAME].
TTC	My daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life.
TTC	“And whose fault was that?”
TTC	He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things.
TTC	She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.
TTC	“Not of [NAME]?”
TTC	The three glided by, and went silently down.
TTC	“I think you may take that liberty,” the [NAME] answered, smiling.
TTC	“There are only the usual odours.”
TTC	Never mind your having no enjoyment of women’s society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it.
TTC	“Silence, patriots!”  [NAME] came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him!
TTC	There was a murmur of commiseration as [NAME] [NAME] crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave him good wishes and encouragement.
TTC	“Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder!
TTC	“Will you take charge of the letter?” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	We men of business, who serve a [NAME], are not our own masters.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was called to confirm it, and did so.
TTC	I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave.
TTC	A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same [NAME], the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.
TTC	To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
TTC	[NAME], still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”
TTC	My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband’s name, may be placed over him to show where he lies.
TTC	“You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don’t wonder at it.
TTC	But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night.
TTC	But I’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”
TTC	She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.
TTC	Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him.
TTC	He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to [NAME] to pause.
TTC	There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.”
TTC	He helped [NAME] [NAME] to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old [NAME], into the misty air of [NAME]-[NAME].
TTC	You know the consequences of mixing them?”
TTC	“The news is of him.
TTC	You are again the prisoner of the [NAME].”
TTC	For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of [NAME], patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of [NAME]’s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.
TTC	“At extermination,” said madame.
TTC	“No dinner?”
TTC	You can say what it is.”
TTC	As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our [NAME] here to our [NAME] there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in [NAME]’s confidence.
TTC	I denounce them to [NAME] and to earth.”
TTC	He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to [NAME], and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] came up at the moment, and touched [NAME] [NAME] on the arm.
TTC	[NAME] and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in [NAME]-[NAME], with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
TTC	[NAME], pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.
TTC	“And you in brown!”
TTC	It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.
TTC	Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before [NAME] [NAME]’s name was called.
TTC	“Now you know all about it, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	For the first time the [NAME] felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power.
TTC	He said that this business had, within a few days, taken him to [NAME], and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between [NAME] and [NAME] for a long time to come.”
TTC	That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime.
TTC	But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here.
TTC	How could she be!
TTC	On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join [NAME] and her husband.
TTC	I have a business charge to acquit myself of.
TTC	Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.”
TTC	“Under what law, and for what offence?”
TTC	[NAME], in addition, such phrases as “Ah! yes!
TTC	“An urgent case in the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], he said.
TTC	We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake.
TTC	Keep me my usual chair.
TTC	Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful.
TTC	“Did he though?
TTC	I may read this?”
TTC	“Yes,” said the [NAME].
TTC	He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward.
TTC	The shadow attendant on [NAME] [NAME] and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast.
TTC	“I can’t undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself.
TTC	The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time.
TTC	“[NAME], the man.”
TTC	Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME], from a congress of British subjects in [NAME]: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the [NAME]-lane brood.
TTC	Take care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take care of itself.
TTC	The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he had [NAME] without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent.
TTC	He then conducted the young [NAME] [NAME] to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.
TTC	“Your husband, [NAME]?”  “[NAME].”
TTC	“I don’t think I do like, if I may speak my mind.
TTC	The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing anything but stopping.
TTC	“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was [NAME]”
TTC	If I do--Well,” said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, “I’ll use it!”
TTC	But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
TTC	croaked the [NAME].
TTC	I’m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing.
TTC	*****  The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that same hour of the early afternoon, on the [NAME] with the crowd about it, when a coach going out of [NAME] drives up to be examined.
TTC	Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.
TTC	He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound.
TTC	He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.
TTC	She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word.
TTC	“Tell me what it is.”
TTC	All my life might have been.”
TTC	From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.
TTC	The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe.
TTC	The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as [NAME] [NAME] stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME], emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined [NAME] [NAME] in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before.
TTC	“Of his own desire?”  “Of his own necessity.
TTC	It will be his Ghost--not him!”
TTC	But, though the [NAME] tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get [NAME] [NAME] set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him.
TTC	He repeated what he had already said.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], your mother took this course with you.
TTC	Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?”
TTC	And shall I hang back, when [NAME]’s knows this and says this--[NAME]’s, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints?
TTC	“Pray sit down.”
TTC	repeated [NAME], bitterly.
TTC	There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining.
TTC	I have been dining with the day’s client; or seeing him dine--it’s all one!”
TTC	She looked an old woman, but was young.
TTC	“I do not think so.
TTC	That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the [NAME], to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers.
TTC	He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter.
TTC	She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which [NAME] had occupied.
TTC	He is a good child, this mender of roads, called [NAME].
TTC	Could it have lived an hour as happily?”
TTC	Come hither, little citizen.”
TTC	Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging [NAME] that was running so fearfully wild.
TTC	“It is you, [NAME]!
TTC	“_Is_ that the [NAME] mail?”
TTC	It elicited an answering chorus of “Good day!”
TTC	The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him.
TTC	“They only come from the heart, [NAME].
TTC	“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest.
TTC	Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
TTC	As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, [NAME] [NAME]’s thoughts seemed to cloud too.
TTC	He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?”
TTC	“But access to him,” said [NAME] [NAME], “if it should go ill before the [NAME], will not save him.”
TTC	the [NAME] reminded him.
TTC	“[NAME]!” rejoined [NAME] [NAME]; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”
TTC	Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME], of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or [NAME].
TTC	“Eh well!” said [NAME] [NAME], raising her eyebrows with a cool business air.
TTC	“You are a noble heart.
TTC	[NAME], my postilions!
TTC	Why don’t you go and fetch things?
TTC	The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation.
TTC	“And do you really go to-night?”
TTC	I knew what [NAME] influence was, and what the immunities of the [NAME] were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind.
TTC	He cannot pay something?”
TTC	I’ll say gallantry.
TTC	The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time, deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference.
TTC	You summon no energy and purpose.
TTC	The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.
TTC	It is [NAME] [NAME] who has replied to all the previous questions.
TTC	As she did so, [NAME] turned to the followers of the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME], and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.
TTC	Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village.
TTC	All this was in a second.
TTC	Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.
TTC	From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours.
TTC	The drum’s was the only voice in [NAME] [NAME] that blood and hurry had not changed.
TTC	He watched his opportunity of taking [NAME] aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard.
TTC	“Really, then?” said [NAME] [NAME], as an amendment.
TTC	When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], on the instinct of the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
TTC	The three customers pulled off their hats to [NAME] [NAME], with three flourishes.
TTC	Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.
TTC	“Is it not impressive, [NAME] [NAME]?” asked [NAME].
TTC	“Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically shaking a forefinger at him.
TTC	“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said [NAME] [NAME], patting her hand.
TTC	“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist, “because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime.
TTC	“I ain’t a going to be blest out of house and home.
TTC	But, unfortunately, there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”
TTC	She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the jerks.”
TTC	I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you.
TTC	It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on.
TTC	She will be mourning and grieving.
TTC	There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.
TTC	The scene was [NAME] [NAME]’s private lodging in [NAME]-sword-alley, [NAME]: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy [NAME] morning, [NAME] [NAME] seventeen hundred and eighty.
TTC	“‘Recalled to life.’
TTC	For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground.
TTC	“I am that child, I hope, my father.
TTC	He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall, is under the control of the [NAME], and has been rehearsed by [NAME] [NAME] as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned [NAME]’s name--“making signs and signals to prisoners.
TTC	It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is.
TTC	The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.
TTC	Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever.
TTC	I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other’s soul, than I was in the souls of both.
TTC	“Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful cry; “but give me my work!
TTC	“Just now, if at all.”
TTC	He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.
TTC	The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner.
TTC	“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.
TTC	You will be sure to hear when the jury come in.
TTC	From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her.
TTC	I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road.
TTC	“You know that you are recalled to life?”
TTC	If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
TTC	It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here.
TTC	Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.
TTC	His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity.
TTC	Let them all lean upon him.
TTC	[NAME]  There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
TTC	I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other.
TTC	“I replied to the [NAME], sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to [NAME], and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection.
TTC	There was a blank silence.
TTC	The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to [NAME]’s establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:  “[NAME] wanted!”
TTC	He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and [NAME] [NAME] awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.
TTC	When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, [NAME] [NAME] rose and said to him:  “Will you go out?”
TTC	It was told me by the [NAME] that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature.
TTC	And, [NAME], if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, [NAME] [NAME] as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance.
TTC	He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep.
TTC	Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman’s sympathy.
TTC	“I give the promise,” said the [NAME], “without any condition.
TTC	Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?”
TTC	The child answered her bravely, ‘Yes!’
TTC	There was another silence.
TTC	What can this be!
TTC	She was a good girl.
TTC	That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.
TTC	“She might think a thousand things,” [NAME] said, “and any of them would only add to her trouble.
TTC	With a sigh of great compassion.
TTC	“The usual noises,” [NAME] [NAME] replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.
TTC	“[NAME]-ways rusty!
TTC	repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.
TTC	Her father considered a little before he answered:  “You have seen [NAME] [NAME] here, yourself.
TTC	“No,” said [NAME] [NAME], in reply to the [NAME]; “I have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.”
TTC	[NAME] turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said:  “I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off?
TTC	Like [NAME] [NAME], your father, the gentleman was of repute in [NAME].
TTC	She was pale and trembling.
TTC	He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
TTC	Except one man, who got up and went out.
TTC	So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls.
TTC	“Oh, the men, the men!”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition.
TTC	How does it feel?
TTC	“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so long [NAME]”  [NAME] [NAME] moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids.
TTC	In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father’s did, kept the required watch upon his mother.
TTC	There was no cessation, but the regular moment’s pause, in the utterance of these sounds.
TTC	It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.
TTC	‘Doctor, your clients are people of condition.
TTC	Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions.
TTC	It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.
TTC	[NAME] went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”
TTC	You’ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
TTC	“Two French gentlemen.”
TTC	My parting blessing on my love.
TTC	“Try them again.
TTC	Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.
TTC	If you want me to guess, you must ask me to dinner.”
TTC	[NAME] closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:  “[NAME] One, [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] [NAME]!
TTC	The “sharp female newly-born, and called [NAME] [NAME],” was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name.
TTC	“If it will do you any good, [NAME] [NAME], if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!”
TTC	So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him.
TTC	The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child.
TTC	“Keep it for me until to-morrow.
TTC	“Will you try?”
TTC	He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.
TTC	This is she?”
TTC	I have overheard words of that woman’s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours.
TTC	After sipping his cognac to the end, he added:  “Yes, [NAME] [NAME] is going to be married.
TTC	Well, that ’ud be imposing, too, on [NAME]’s.
TTC	I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding.
TTC	While he was at a loss, [NAME] said, resuming his former air of contemplating cards:
TTC	“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.”
TTC	I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”
TTC	But he will perish; there is no real hope.”
TTC	And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.
TTC	When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.
TTC	He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for [NAME] and [NAME]
TTC	“Is that his child?” said [NAME] [NAME], stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little [NAME] as if it were the finger of [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard.
TTC	As often as I caught the younger brother’s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy.
TTC	The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a [NAME] at home.
TTC	“I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here for their merits; that is enough.”
TTC	A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
TTC	[NAME] had fallen on him in its place.
TTC	“I have known [NAME] [NAME] and his daughter, in [NAME].”
TTC	It has died in a moment without pain.
TTC	“I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.”
TTC	For my child’s sake!
TTC	“How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice.
TTC	She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure.
TTC	“[NAME], dear!
TTC	He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head.
TTC	“[NAME] can depart.
TTC	Let me follow in her steps.”
TTC	[NAME] drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his hand.
TTC	She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me--Well!
TTC	“What I suppose, [NAME] [NAME], I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,” said [NAME] [NAME], quickly flushing again, “I will not--not even at [NAME]--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.”
TTC	“I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother’s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy.
TTC	I have seen it many times.
TTC	Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.
TTC	“If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose [NAME] would have cast my lot in an island?”
TTC	For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of [NAME] [NAME], the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back.
TTC	“So, then!
TTC	It died out, as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily shook his head.
TTC	“An enemy to the [NAME]!”
TTC	Look at me.”
TTC	Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for [NAME] [NAME]; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed [NAME]’s.
TTC	Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.
TTC	It is a pretty sight!”
TTC	When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible:  “How goes it, [NAME]?”  “All well, [NAME].”
TTC	“What the [NAME], I say again!”
TTC	“They call me [NAME].”
TTC	In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at [NAME] the [NAME] petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.
TTC	Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.
TTC	“Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the prisoner.
TTC	I am busy.
TTC	They again joined hands.
TTC	“Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”
TTC	After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and [NAME], [NAME]--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands--to dig this wretched creature out.
TTC	[NAME] is summoned for to-morrow.”
TTC	Hold the light higher, you!”
TTC	“He has always kept it by him,” said [NAME] [NAME], with an anxious look at his friend.
TTC	“My husband.
TTC	She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his.
TTC	He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears.
TTC	I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no more.
TTC	But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it.
TTC	“Listen, then!
TTC	Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] twice stopped to rest.
TTC	What did you say?”
TTC	It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to [NAME].
TTC	That’s an excellent card.
TTC	“[NAME] is my husband!” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Here they are!” said [NAME] [NAME], rising to break up the conference; “and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”
TTC	Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.
TTC	I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the [NAME] by the multitude of enemies of the [NAME] with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the [NAME]--in fact, had rather passed out of the [NAME]’s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the [NAME]’s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen [NAME], called [NAME].
TTC	Behold the manner of it.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] then called his few witnesses, and [NAME] [NAME] had next to attend while [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] turned the whole suit of clothes [NAME] [NAME] had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how [NAME] and [NAME] were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse.
TTC	The passage to the [NAME] was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold.
TTC	It is for their safety.”
TTC	Who was called accordingly.
TTC	“It is the fashion,” growled the man.
TTC	It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.
TTC	I encouraged [NAME] [NAME] in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her.
TTC	the face of [NAME] is for a moment turned towards him.
TTC	If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
TTC	“I fear you are not well, [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful.
TTC	It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of [NAME] [NAME], where she had stood hundreds of times.
TTC	“_She_ pretty?”  “Is she not?”
TTC	I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to [NAME]; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place.
TTC	“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish.
TTC	He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful.
TTC	Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!
TTC	He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out.
TTC	There were four in the room, and she shut them all.
TTC	I pass to worse news.
TTC	“Do you call the whole reckoning?” said [NAME].
TTC	What the two drank together, between [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME], might have floated a king’s ship.
TTC	She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save [NAME], but they were very slight.
TTC	Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
TTC	He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers.
TTC	The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap.
TTC	“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
TTC	Accept my cordial thanks.”
TTC	Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.
TTC	“I hope so.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME]”; [NAME] [NAME] laid his hand upon [NAME]’s arm; “do you remember nothing of this man?
TTC	“[NAME], no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.
TTC	There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about.
TTC	[NAME] who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him!
TTC	It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother’s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you.
TTC	While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I met him--by accident--a day and half’s journey out of [NAME].
TTC	“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring.
TTC	There is no help for it.”
TTC	Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it.
TTC	Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of [NAME] for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out [NAME] and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth.
TTC	“Then why not change it?”
TTC	He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.
TTC	For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then [NAME] [NAME] saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of--“Live the [NAME] prisoner!
TTC	The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone.
TTC	“It is true,” said [NAME], who was kneeling to look on and hear.
TTC	Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail.
TTC	“Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”
TTC	“I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by.
TTC	On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter [NAME]  “I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger of suffocation.
TTC	“Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don’t know what papers.”
TTC	Her father sat silent, with his face bent down.
TTC	“Ah! most gracious [NAME] heretofore the [NAME], where is that emigrant?
TTC	“I send it to her by you.
TTC	“The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?”
TTC	“Recall it.”
TTC	“I am highly gratified,” said [NAME] [NAME], “though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one.
TTC	She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.
TTC	“[NAME],” returned [NAME], drawing himself up, “if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of it--not a syllable of it.
TTC	Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.
TTC	You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in [NAME] and thereabouts, even [NAME]’s shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him.
TTC	On this occasion, [NAME] [NAME], responding to [NAME]’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.
TTC	An [NAME]  Worn out by anxious watching, [NAME] [NAME] fell asleep at his post.
TTC	“Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said [NAME] to the turnkey.
TTC	“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it.
TTC	I know, [NAME] [NAME]--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself.
TTC	“I have had the happiness, [NAME] [NAME], of being so intimate here,”  so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may [NAME]”  He was stayed by the [NAME]’s putting out his hand to stop him.
TTC	The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of [NAME] [NAME], in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying [NAME].
TTC	I don’t care an [NAME] [NAME] for myself.
TTC	[NAME] gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper.
TTC	Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great [NAME], than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.
TTC	Still, the [NAME] walked among the terrors with a steady head.
TTC	I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”
TTC	“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that [NAME] [NAME] must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an unusual concourse pouring down [NAME]-street westward, attracted his attention.
TTC	There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out.
TTC	But--really, you know, [NAME] [NAME]” [NAME] [NAME] paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, “you know there really is so much too much of you!”
TTC	It ought to be, it must be, I’ll swear it’s there.”
TTC	Had he ever been a spy himself?
TTC	Time presses: I must finish those shoes.”
TTC	Go tell her that I wish to see her.
TTC	“I listened to the patient’s breathing, and avoided answering.
TTC	Only hear them!”
TTC	I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.”
TTC	“Nothing connected with [NAME] was concealed from me.
TTC	For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.
TTC	A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his view, floated by him, and died away.
TTC	A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.
TTC	And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.
TTC	I’ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”
TTC	“How long would you keep me in town?”
TTC	If I might embrace him once!
TTC	“All things have worked together as they have fallen out.
TTC	“What is that?”
TTC	He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father’s state, and I am sure he felt it.
TTC	It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.
TTC	and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, [NAME] [NAME] betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.
TTC	Of late, the neglected bed in the [NAME] [NAME] had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.
TTC	He looks into the first of them: not there.
TTC	Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.
TTC	“[NAME], sir,” said [NAME] [NAME], and quietly stepped with him to the door.
TTC	So quick was the [NAME] to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours.
TTC	“Yes, sir.”
TTC	As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, [NAME] the [NAME] clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.
TTC	A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
TTC	Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope.
TTC	“You see, too,” said the [NAME], tremulously, “it is such an old companion.”
TTC	Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
TTC	Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so.
TTC	So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground.
TTC	I well understand that, even if [NAME] [NAME] held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”
TTC	Nobody had made any acknowledgment of [NAME] [NAME]’s part in the day’s proceedings; nobody had known of it.
TTC	Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible.
TTC	“What man, pig?
TTC	“[NAME], man!” returned [NAME], stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now?
TTC	If your business necessitated your seeing “the [NAME],” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the [NAME] came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight.
TTC	While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual [NAME] thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.
TTC	Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger.
TTC	My tea, my dear!
TTC	Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
TTC	“I want a passenger, if it is.”
TTC	He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”
TTC	“I am not frightened for myself, my father.
TTC	says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’
TTC	Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don’t move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
TTC	His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head.
TTC	Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father.
TTC	Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I tell her!
TTC	“When [NAME] the [NAME] demands that evening, ‘Say, what is he like?’
TTC	“Good,” said the imperturbable master.
TTC	That’s the sentence.”
TTC	“Good patriots will know what that means.
TTC	“Of what?” asked the [NAME].
TTC	They advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped.
TTC	I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls.
TTC	“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”
TTC	My husband, the forester.”
TTC	“The child also,” observed [NAME] [NAME], with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes.
TTC	Is it [NAME]?”  (“I don’t like [NAME]’s voice, if it is [NAME],” growled the guard to himself.
TTC	The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the [NAME], which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused.
TTC	“Yes, my [NAME].”
TTC	Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all [NAME] [NAME] to dance at the sight of.
TTC	And why look there?”
TTC	“Yes, dearest.”
TTC	“The [NAME] [NAME], called [NAME],” said the first.
TTC	Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!
TTC	“[NAME], my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake.
TTC	The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was--or so [NAME] thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
TTC	He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the [NAME] as if nothing unusual had occurred.
TTC	The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
TTC	That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise.
TTC	Very ill at ease with himself, and with [NAME] and most other men, [NAME] made the best of his way into the quiet of the [NAME], opened the letter, and read it.
TTC	So much more wicked and distracted had the [NAME] grown in that [NAME] month, that the rivers of the [NAME] were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun.
TTC	Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace--[NAME] [NAME] had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the [NAME], like birds of prey from their high perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him out!
TTC	He knew very well, that in his love for [NAME], his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete.
TTC	“Don’t be ungrateful.
TTC	“The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second.
TTC	I am sure not.
TTC	Which is he?”
TTC	the counting up to twelve, and ‘Hush!’
TTC	But there is no one there.”
TTC	“By whom?”  “Three voices.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.
TTC	“These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.
TTC	The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time.
TTC	His first impression was confirmed.
TTC	“In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it.
TTC	Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation!
TTC	Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; [NAME], that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the [NAME] looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	What do you say?”
TTC	“Were you travelling alone, [NAME] [NAME], or with any companion?”
TTC	This is to tell him you are there.”
TTC	Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it.
TTC	It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race.
TTC	I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight.
TTC	As a wife and mother!”
TTC	“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her.
TTC	“The people from the market did it.
TTC	“‘She is dead,’ said [NAME]  “‘I congratulate you, my brother,’ were his words as he turned round.
TTC	In short, I should make that choice.
TTC	“The name of that prisoner was [NAME], and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of [NAME]; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, [NAME], prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed!
TTC	Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a [NAME] and a thorough [NAME]; the woman, evidently [NAME].
TTC	He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards.
TTC	Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, [NAME], the turnkey, and [NAME] [NAME], linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make.
TTC	He’s as thin as a lath.
TTC	“Don’t recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is better so.
TTC	This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards.
TTC	Yes; he had better be taken to her.
TTC	How many times?
TTC	The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted.
TTC	She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune.
TTC	“You are the young lady just now referred to?”
TTC	In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier’s.
TTC	At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him.
TTC	I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you.
TTC	“So I’ll nod my head,” thought [NAME] [NAME], amazed, “at all events she’ll see that.”
TTC	This much, [NAME], with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, [NAME] [NAME], stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] was making ready to speak.
TTC	Here, [NAME] [NAME] became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall.
TTC	The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness.
TTC	“No, miss,” returned [NAME], “it shall not be named to you.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father.
TTC	“I was startled, and asked, ‘Is it a pressing case?’
TTC	Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
TTC	“And why not, citizen?”  “He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
TTC	Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
TTC	It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.”
TTC	He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”
TTC	“[NAME] would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere.
TTC	“Pray take a seat, sir.”
TTC	“She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage.
TTC	He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter.
TTC	The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none.
TTC	The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness.
TTC	It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing.
TTC	“Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”
TTC	“Only one thing more,” said [NAME] [NAME], laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed.
TTC	Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made.
TTC	“Any person mentioned?”
TTC	He got his arm round her, and held her.
TTC	The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the [NAME] of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of [NAME] [NAME]; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of [NAME], as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the [NAME] and under the clouds of the [NAME], in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
TTC	I pledge you, but I deny the beauty.
TTC	Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, [NAME] [NAME] said nothing when her [NAME] came in, but coughed just one grain of cough.
TTC	“Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?”
TTC	Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat.
TTC	“Why does he make that abominable noise?
TTC	Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?
TTC	I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, [NAME] will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”
TTC	Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that [NAME] [NAME], still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of [NAME], the treacherous foe of the [NAME] crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find.
TTC	His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master.
TTC	He was then dying fast.
TTC	“Why, yes, of [NAME].
TTC	cried the same scowling red-cap.
TTC	I have no feeling either way.
TTC	The officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written, sanded it, and handed it to [NAME], with the words “In secret.”
TTC	“Since I must say so, I know it.”
TTC	“I remember it too.
TTC	I knew it would be so; I knew I could help [NAME] out of all danger; I told [NAME] [NAME] is that noise?”
TTC	What a disordered state you are in!
TTC	Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a flush of pride in it.
TTC	At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud.
TTC	Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, [NAME] said, “Go on, [NAME].”
TTC	There,” said [NAME], making a dab at [NAME] [NAME]’s lips with his own.
TTC	“I always am sound; am I not?”
TTC	Probably, [NAME] [NAME] passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
TTC	He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.
TTC	No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.
TTC	“Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”
TTC	Will you come and see her?”
TTC	His condition was that of a young gentleman.
TTC	“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”
TTC	“They ain’t worth much, then.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on [NAME]’s arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to [NAME], there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man.
TTC	Bring him to the lamp!”
TTC	If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on [NAME] [NAME], it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.
TTC	“For the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
TTC	His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
TTC	He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip.
TTC	[NAME] bless you!”
TTC	In a few moments, a man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his name.
TTC	“I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent.
TTC	[NAME], dear friend!”
TTC	Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided her breast.
TTC	The time went very slowly on, and [NAME] [NAME]’s hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] made at the door.
TTC	“Don’t tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement.
TTC	My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.
TTC	All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.
TTC	Provide somebody to take care of you.
TTC	“Come here.”
TTC	“Yes, sir.
TTC	It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with.
TTC	It was an ordinance of the [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] of [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground.
TTC	How can it be!
TTC	They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
TTC	No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street.
TTC	Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless.
TTC	“It ought to have been finished long ago.
TTC	“The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him.
TTC	“Judge you!
TTC	“My opinion, miss,” returned [NAME] [NAME], “is as you’re right.
TTC	“When passed?”
TTC	He had since seen her, in the [NAME] of [NAME] [NAME], over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up.
TTC	[NAME] has been my bodyguard on [NAME] nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
TTC	Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-[NAME] of [NAME], picking up [NAME], and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere.”
TTC	In a quarter of an hour [NAME] was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper.
TTC	Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by [NAME] [NAME], and was wrought into the fatal register.
TTC	The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the [NAME] mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood.
TTC	It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the [NAME] and [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], with the basket, walked at her side.
TTC	“Yes--[NAME]”  After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen [NAME] at the ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”
TTC	Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last [NAME] were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
TTC	There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across.
TTC	“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire.
TTC	[NAME], equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!
TTC	“A bad truth for you,” said [NAME], speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him.
TTC	Wouldn’t her child?”
TTC	Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission.
TTC	“Now, let me see,” said [NAME] [NAME], pondering again.
TTC	Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that [NAME] put out a hand and seized him, crying:  “[NAME], no!
TTC	You will save them all.”
TTC	Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again.
TTC	“I don’t hear it.”
TTC	As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.
TTC	“As to the great service,” said [NAME], “I am bound to avow to you, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I don’t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind!
TTC	Men of business may speak to [NAME] [NAME] now?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.
TTC	He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
TTC	Well, [NAME] [NAME], I was about to [NAME] might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to [NAME] [NAME] to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to [NAME] [NAME] to have the task of being explicit with you.
TTC	“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose.
TTC	“There are two other points,” said [NAME] [NAME], “on which I am anxious to be instructed.
TTC	Necessarily, being the last.”
TTC	The end of the first book.
TTC	“[NAME].  “Give me your hand.
TTC	“Now, my dear [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters.
TTC	His resolution was made.
TTC	Or to do anything?
TTC	“Now, I trust,” said [NAME] to him, “that the name and influence of [NAME] [NAME] may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he would be before the [NAME] again to-morrow, [NAME] [NAME]”  “Yes; I believe so.”
TTC	“The utmost good that I am capable of now, [NAME] [NAME], I have come here to realise.
TTC	“You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.
TTC	They are here.”
TTC	Roar and roar.
TTC	“Dare I ask you to explain?”
TTC	Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there.
TTC	“How goes the [NAME]?”  “You mean the [NAME].
TTC	asked the man he had spoken with.
TTC	As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-[NAME] could produce somebody in “the [NAME]’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.
TTC	The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and [NAME] [NAME] and his son went home to tea.
TTC	You’d be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, [NAME]!”  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.
TTC	When you go to [NAME], do as [NAME] does.
TTC	“See here then, [NAME] the [NAME],” said [NAME], getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of [NAME] inside, with the white head.
TTC	If you have, don’t expect me to keep your secret.
TTC	After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent.
TTC	Only one soul was to be seen, and that was [NAME] [NAME]--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
TTC	I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank.”
TTC	“Will nothing of it remain?
TTC	For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander.
TTC	“Have no fear!
TTC	“‘Do you doubt them?’
TTC	the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill.
TTC	When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.
TTC	“Saying your prayers!
TTC	It hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good.
TTC	“She came out here,” he said, looking about him, “turned this way, must have trod on these stones often.
TTC	Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband’s cheerfully.”
TTC	Some of us at [NAME]’s are getting old, and we really can’t be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.”
TTC	There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up.
TTC	“Bring me hither that fellow!” said the [NAME] to the courier.
TTC	“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”
TTC	exclaimed [NAME], recalling the [NAME] at which he had assisted.
TTC	“I am not crying,” said [NAME] [NAME]; “_you_ are.”
TTC	Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart.
TTC	At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea that _he_ don’t get no law-work to do.
TTC	“She is going to be married.”
TTC	The door-keeper will pass the note to [NAME] [NAME], and do you make any gesture that will attract [NAME] [NAME]’s attention, and show him where you stand.
TTC	Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from [NAME]’s side of the tides to the opposite shore.
TTC	“What’s _he_ got to do with the case?”
TTC	“I think,” he whispered to [NAME] [NAME], after anxious consideration, “I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
TTC	“Did he say anything about [NAME], [NAME] [NAME]?
TTC	“May be so, [NAME] [NAME]; may be not.
TTC	If I knew which [NAME] threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.”
TTC	Bring that rascal!’
TTC	He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets.
TTC	What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”
TTC	But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”
TTC	The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on [NAME] [NAME]’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.
TTC	As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that [NAME] [NAME] wanted, by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.”
TTC	“[NAME], I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud.
TTC	All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.
TTC	Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the [NAME] and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.
TTC	The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
TTC	“And the maker’s name?” said [NAME].
TTC	“To me, women!” cried madame his wife.
TTC	The way out of court lay in that direction, and [NAME] followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes.
TTC	Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s mind.
TTC	There is nothing in you to like; you know that.
TTC	To [NAME] [NAME], the [NAME] communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	All is lost!”
TTC	Assuming for a moment, that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?”
TTC	Where could he be?
TTC	But, the [NAME] people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.”
TTC	“He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name.
TTC	“Don’t be alarmed, my dear [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The [NAME] had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read.
TTC	I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.
TTC	And now I’ll have no more drink; I’ll get to bed.”
TTC	“I don’t wonder at it; it’s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another.
TTC	[NAME], they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want.
TTC	“Without doubt.
TTC	“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it.
TTC	Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity.
TTC	Dead, is he?”
TTC	It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner.
TTC	The prisoner wrung his hand.
TTC	Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often.
TTC	“Simply, ‘that he has received the letter, and will come.’”
TTC	Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”
TTC	The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
TTC	But, I would not take it away while he was present.
TTC	There was no way through it, and the front windows of the [NAME]’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it.
TTC	On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it.
TTC	The ministers of [NAME] [NAME] are robed and ready.
TTC	It is all the same.
TTC	“And you have observed, my wife,” said [NAME], in a deprecatory manner, “the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”
TTC	Let it be removed when he is not there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.”
TTC	In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen or heard.
TTC	“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”
TTC	He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from [NAME]’s immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.
TTC	And the old answer:  “I can’t say.”
TTC	They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright.
TTC	When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these things, [NAME] found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed the guard to open the barrier.
TTC	It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	Open the blinds.”
TTC	“I am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.
TTC	When [NAME] [NAME] was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know.
TTC	The [NAME]-fever will have been too much for him?”  Greatly too much for him.
TTC	In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
TTC	Don’t speak of me to her.
TTC	“Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question?
TTC	His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows.
TTC	Have you got it?”
TTC	I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!”
TTC	They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep.
TTC	The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
TTC	A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it.
TTC	“_What’s_ the matter?”  “Ten o’clock, [NAME].”
TTC	Walking here again, citizeness?”
TTC	It flashed upon [NAME] [NAME]’s mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight.
TTC	“I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning.
TTC	We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty.
TTC	“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed aristocrat!”
TTC	I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter.
TTC	Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever.
TTC	Here is my knife,”  throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw.
TTC	But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and blessed her.”
TTC	He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity.
TTC	[NAME] proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.”
TTC	“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.
TTC	This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two others.
TTC	They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable.
TTC	T’other one’s was one syllable.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the [NAME] heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun.
TTC	The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them.
TTC	He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him.
TTC	he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey.
TTC	The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-[NAME].
TTC	“Be comforted!”
TTC	We don’t know what may happen.”
TTC	“[NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s a [NAME]-[NAME]?”  [NAME] [NAME] came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How should I know?”
TTC	We ought to have six score a day.”
TTC	Not more than other gentlemen do.
TTC	The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.
TTC	[NAME], friend, quick!”
TTC	“I wish I were going myself,” said [NAME] [NAME], somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.
TTC	She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words.
TTC	“On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air.
TTC	It had once been noted at the [NAME], that while [NAME] [NAME] was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments.
TTC	Over and over again.
TTC	I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him.
TTC	He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this.
TTC	He murmured for answer: “True.
TTC	So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the [NAME] [NAME], until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the [NAME].
TTC	Me and two more knows it.”
TTC	Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away.
TTC	“I am sorry for it.”
TTC	“I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to hook [NAME] [NAME] into the discussion, “that your respect for my [NAME]”  “I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“My English brother [NAME],” mourned [NAME] [NAME], casting up her tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners!
TTC	I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask.
TTC	“Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, [NAME] [NAME]; I have come for a private word.”
TTC	“You spoke of his daughter.
TTC	“Don’t despond,” said [NAME], very gently; “don’t grieve.
TTC	“The worst.”
TTC	“Well, my sweet,” said [NAME] [NAME], nodding her head emphatically, “the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] the [NAME];” [NAME] [NAME] curtseyed at the name; “and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, [NAME] their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, [NAME] save the [NAME]!”
TTC	Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.
TTC	[NAME] complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire.
TTC	[NAME] noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before, [NAME].
TTC	So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded.
TTC	asked the [NAME], whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.
TTC	As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets!
TTC	Is the moment come?”
TTC	“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”
TTC	“I think so, [NAME], by this time.”
TTC	The [NAME] [NAME]  To the eyes of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME], sitting on his stool in [NAME]-[NAME] with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented.
TTC	I’ll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”
TTC	They paid for their wine, and left the place.
TTC	“Why need you tell me what I have not asked?
TTC	“Take off his head!”
TTC	“Who goes here?
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] spy,” returned his informant.
TTC	He will then let you in.”
TTC	The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments.
TTC	They have had their shameful rights, these [NAME], in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us.
TTC	As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day, [NAME]!”
TTC	You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] quietly chafed the hands that held his arm.
TTC	My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”
TTC	[NAME]’s valise and hot water to [NAME].
TTC	If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were.
TTC	The prisoner came forward directly.
TTC	In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting.
TTC	he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek.
TTC	Not in the wine-shop did [NAME] [NAME] confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads.
TTC	Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair.
TTC	“But this is my father’s story, [NAME]; and I begin to [NAME] curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was left an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to [NAME].
TTC	You will do him no harm.
TTC	“And I am, in plain reality.
TTC	I have had a pattern in my hand.”
TTC	They found it surging and tossing, in quest of [NAME] himself.
TTC	Either [NAME] [NAME] had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or [NAME] [NAME] was on the watch for its disappearance; [NAME], the [NAME] took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.
TTC	How many to the [NAME] to-day?”  “[NAME]-two.”
TTC	“Two to-night, I think.
TTC	[NAME]’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’ mine, I think not.
TTC	“[NAME]?”  “Something that crossed me?”  “I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here.
TTC	“I quite understand it to be a nice question.
TTC	“If you please, sir.”  “[NAME] [NAME], I am a man of business.
TTC	People understood that [NAME][NAME], in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man.
TTC	[NAME] took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.
TTC	“I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.”
TTC	As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones.
TTC	“Indeed?”  “Yes.
TTC	She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME].
TTC	It was in vain for [NAME] [NAME] to struggle and to strike; [NAME] [NAME], with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had.
TTC	“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business?
TTC	“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten.
TTC	The [NAME] was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.
TTC	he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next to.
TTC	“Do I ask you, my dear [NAME], to pass the door?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care.
TTC	“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”
TTC	Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest.
TTC	“An hour, if you please.”
TTC	The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence, [NAME] [NAME] had previously explained to him, and he had written to [NAME] in accordance with it, and she had no suspicions.
TTC	She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] looked at her scornfully, but still with something of [NAME] [NAME]’s own perception that they two were at bay.
TTC	“Then why the devil don’t you dine?
TTC	Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked.
TTC	And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!”
TTC	She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night.
TTC	The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill.
TTC	“It is a pity you have not, [NAME].”
TTC	“Much influence around him, has that Doctor?”
TTC	Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
TTC	“She was pretty enough to have been married long ago.
TTC	He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair.
TTC	and left her.
TTC	He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and, resuming it as his safest place, said:  “[NAME], my friends!
TTC	A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept [NAME] of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!
TTC	That way, [NAME], if you please.
TTC	Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
TTC	Ask my husband, is that so.”
TTC	Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.
TTC	Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.
TTC	Our relations were business relations, but confidential.
TTC	These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”
TTC	She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the [NAME].
TTC	“That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps?
TTC	“If she don’t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey’s end,” said [NAME] [NAME], glancing over his shoulder, “it’s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”
TTC	“[NAME]--n it all, sir!” said [NAME], staring at him, “am I not eligible?”
TTC	On the third day of her being there, he noticed her.
TTC	Shall we terminate our conference for the night?”
TTC	Turn my face to him.’
TTC	He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets.
TTC	I asked leave to--”
TTC	“Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?”
TTC	As he passed along towards [NAME] [NAME], he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair.
TTC	Would you not?”  “Truly, madame, I think so.
TTC	But it may be true.”
TTC	She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.
TTC	Where is the man who was here?
TTC	Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”  until they left off, of their own will.
TTC	But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this.
TTC	“Did you hear the message?”
TTC	she called to him.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one.
TTC	Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, [NAME] [NAME] requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.
TTC	I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.”
TTC	There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed.
TTC	His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea.
TTC	A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been!
TTC	He is among us!”
TTC	In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers.
TTC	“They are,” [NAME] [NAME] whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, “murdering the prisoners.
TTC	“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the [NAME], touching him on the breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”
TTC	Do what he would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy.
TTC	In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on.
TTC	“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”
TTC	Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do playfully, or [NAME] [NAME], sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried.
TTC	Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every protection.
TTC	Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.
TTC	A [NAME] [NAME]  “[NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”
TTC	He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
TTC	“Hold the horses!
TTC	He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
TTC	Can I restore him to you?”
TTC	There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within.
TTC	Have you any reason to believe that [NAME] loves you?”
TTC	Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.
TTC	“Or you to me,” says [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Ten o’clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake [NAME] [NAME], [NAME].”
TTC	He had expected labour, and he found it, and did it and made the best of it.
TTC	Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”
TTC	Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.
TTC	The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.
TTC	“I never saw you do it yet,” muttered [NAME].
TTC	Ask him, is that so.”
TTC	Had he inherited it?
TTC	A sumptuous man was the [NAME]-[NAME].
TTC	“[NAME], I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the polished [NAME] who was murdered,” said one.
TTC	A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers.
TTC	It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.
TTC	“I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”
TTC	“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, “we never hear about them.
TTC	Bust me if I don’t think he’d been a drinking!”
TTC	Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him.
TTC	He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes.
TTC	The [NAME], husband and wife, The [NAME], and [NAME] [NAME], were in the first press, and at no great distance from him in the [NAME].
TTC	“Is it a good sign, that he wishes to see [NAME] and [NAME]?”  “[NAME],” said [NAME]; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her to thirst for it.
TTC	Oh [NAME] heretofore the [NAME], I pray you be you true to me!
TTC	Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand.
TTC	“Say then, my husband.
TTC	“Not even so.
TTC	“What do you make, madame?”
TTC	“Eh my faith.
TTC	He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the [NAME], the [NAME]-[NAME], the [NAME]-[NAME], the [NAME], the [NAME], the [NAME], the [NAME] [NAME], the [NAME], the whole [NAME] [NAME] in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by.
TTC	And if you’ve got holsters to that saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em.
TTC	A Hand at [NAME]  Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, [NAME] [NAME] threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the [NAME]-[NAME], reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make.
TTC	From the first, I had anxiously considered what I ought to do.
TTC	But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, [NAME]!”
TTC	[NAME] followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face.
TTC	Nobody will suspect [NAME] of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.”
TTC	Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly.
TTC	“Did you ask me for my name?”
TTC	Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen.
TTC	And regarding that name of [NAME], likewise.
TTC	He watched her as she mused, and the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:
TTC	He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image.
TTC	“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street.
TTC	[NAME] be with you!”
TTC	“Lower the lamp yonder!” cried [NAME] [NAME], after glaring round for a new means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!”
TTC	In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, [NAME] [NAME] was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.
TTC	“It-can’t-be,” muttered [NAME] [NAME], retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again.
TTC	“I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly.
TTC	But it is useless to discuss the question.
TTC	“It depends upon how you dewelop your talents.
TTC	There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten.
TTC	Of what profession?
TTC	They were both silent.
TTC	What I stand to, is, that he knows well wot that there [NAME] was never in that there coffin.
TTC	He was also in the habit of declaiming to [NAME] [NAME], over his full-bodied wine, on the arts [NAME] [NAME] had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to be caught.”
TTC	Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.
TTC	The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood.
TTC	It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him, that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his work presently.
TTC	Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in [NAME]: “He has never seen me here; I have kept out of his way.
TTC	here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, [NAME]!”
TTC	“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?”
TTC	And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep.
TTC	How does it come about at all?
TTC	He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way.
TTC	“Well, then,” said [NAME], as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, “it _is_ a long time.”
TTC	The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of [NAME]--through three dark hours.
TTC	“Do you particularly like the man?”
TTC	and would count up to twelve, and say, ‘Hush!’
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.
TTC	The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees, was upon [NAME] the [NAME] by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his chateau was opened to him.
TTC	Nothing but the production of the afflicted [NAME]’s letter from his prison of the [NAME] would have got him on so far.
TTC	The end of the second book.
TTC	“I am not going to guess, at five o’clock in the morning, with my brains frying and sputtering in my head.
TTC	Is it likely?
TTC	She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night.
TTC	“She is an [NAME]!”
TTC	I am not a scholar.”
TTC	“Yes, yes, thank [NAME].
TTC	Buzzing from the blue-flies.
TTC	It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home.
TTC	“You have been a long time coming,” said the [NAME], with a smile.
TTC	How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	“Forbid it,” proceeded [NAME] [NAME], with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now!
TTC	“Is all the spilt wine swallowed?”
TTC	Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol.
TTC	On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.
TTC	He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five to fifty years of age.
TTC	“I salute you, citizeness,”  from the [NAME].
TTC	Look over your hand, [NAME] [NAME], and see what you have.
TTC	Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony.
TTC	I have no time for them, no chance of them.
TTC	The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
TTC	The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.
TTC	Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the sharp female called [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I demand of [NAME], will he not come to deliver me?
TTC	All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]--sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:  “I hope you care to be recalled to life?”
TTC	“Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?”
TTC	In a little while he came.
TTC	“Without doubt.
TTC	“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me, emigrant.”
TTC	“‘He is not here,’ I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referred to the brother.
TTC	You go to the [NAME] to-morrow?”
TTC	Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, [NAME] sat in the [NAME] house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.
TTC	“What is it?” asks [NAME] [NAME], looking out at window.
TTC	You know my vagabond and restless habits.
TTC	“You and your luck, [NAME]! Get to work, get to work.”
TTC	I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.
TTC	“If it is--” Defarge began, and stopped.
TTC	“‘You are [NAME] [NAME]?’ said one.
TTC	Spiritual revelations were conceded to [NAME] at that favoured period, as at this.
TTC	“You knit with great skill, madame.”
TTC	“Oh, botheration!” returned [NAME], with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, “don’t _you_ be moral!”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had lounged in, but he made only Two.
TTC	There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the [NAME].
TTC	If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning.
TTC	“[NAME]?” asked [NAME] [NAME], inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.
TTC	“Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, [NAME].”
TTC	The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, “One must have patience, my dear!”
TTC	They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”
TTC	the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.
TTC	Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, [NAME] [NAME] herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.
TTC	Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.
TTC	Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two.
TTC	“If I may ride with you, [NAME] [NAME], will you let me hold your hand?
TTC	A shadow indeed!
TTC	Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual.
TTC	And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father.
TTC	He took out his purse.
TTC	“It is a great pity,” croaked [NAME] [NAME], dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], called [NAME],” was at length arraigned.
TTC	When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red [NAME] shirt, said:  “You know him, you have said.
TTC	A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.
TTC	“I speak for myself,” answered [NAME] [NAME], “and for [NAME] [NAME], and for [NAME] [NAME], and--[NAME] [NAME], do you not think I may speak for us all?”
TTC	Her name and family?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] slept, the [NAME] slept: even The [NAME] slept with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest.
TTC	“‘Doctor, they are very proud, these [NAME]; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes.
TTC	[NAME] had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among [NAME] [NAME]’s papers before the setting in of the long vacation.
TTC	“As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it.
TTC	“Can’t be helped,” said [NAME] [NAME], shaking her head.
TTC	The answers to this question were various and contradictory.
TTC	He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third.
TTC	Thus, [NAME] [NAME], in a stern voice, to [NAME] [NAME], as they began ascending the stairs.
TTC	“I am going now, directly.”
TTC	“And sleeping soundly.”
TTC	And _I_ know you’re [NAME], you know.
TTC	We were all tenants of his--that man’s who stands there.
TTC	The trees and the night are all that are here.”
TTC	“In a word,” [NAME] [NAME] went on, “my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this [NAME] with any sensibility.
TTC	The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.’
TTC	Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.
TTC	“Stay long enough, and I shall knit ‘BARSAD’ before you go.”
TTC	And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over [NAME].
TTC	She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had.
TTC	“We are thoughtful to-night!” said [NAME], drawing his arm about her.
TTC	“Why, to be sure!”
TTC	“That’s true,” [NAME] [NAME] acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on [NAME].
TTC	When she was again in his arms, he said to her:
TTC	“What is the matter?”
TTC	no, nor yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at [NAME]’s, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages--ah!
TTC	“[NAME], [NAME] [NAME]; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving.
TTC	“Under a threat?”  “Oh!
TTC	“Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] [NAME]’s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and The [NAME], uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about her head like all the [NAME] [NAME] at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women.
TTC	When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called [NAME] must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground.
TTC	“[NAME]; but before I go on,” said [NAME], shaking his head in his bullying way, “I’ll have this out with you.
TTC	We want wine, among the rest.
TTC	“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued [NAME] [NAME]; “I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here.
TTC	Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	That was very thoughtful!”
TTC	Let him say he was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;” [NAME] [NAME] dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”
TTC	Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded.
TTC	Good-humoured looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man.
TTC	It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left.
TTC	The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he [NAME]  “I’ll tell you,” said [NAME].
TTC	he said, filling his new goblet.
TTC	[NAME] and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted.
TTC	Good day, one and all!”  “Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”
TTC	“As if I was not already full to bursting!”
TTC	That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have [NAME] [NAME] brought before the lawless [NAME], and examined.
TTC	He now stepped up to where [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] stood upon the pavement.
TTC	He occupied rooms in the [NAME], in his fidelity to the [NAME] of which he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy.
TTC	He set down his glass untouched.
TTC	Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
TTC	“Nevertheless,” pursued [NAME], rising to ring the bell, “there is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.”
TTC	It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of [NAME] and [NAME], there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the [NAME], [NAME], to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.
TTC	This exordium, and [NAME] [NAME]’s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, [NAME] flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, [NAME] the bell, and ordered in another.
TTC	“But my dear!”
TTC	The [NAME] asked, why had he returned to [NAME] when he did, and not sooner?
TTC	He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.
TTC	“[NAME], I can do neither.”
TTC	“[NAME], it is true.
TTC	When they passed a prison of the [NAME], they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers.
TTC	“What do you say?”
TTC	I kiss her by you.
TTC	But it’s not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do.
TTC	He looks into the second: not there.
TTC	Customers entered, and the group was broken up.
TTC	“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you.
TTC	Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees.
TTC	It was the last day of the year.
TTC	Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”
TTC	“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said [NAME] [NAME], frowning.
TTC	“That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.
TTC	“He shall be registered to-morrow.”
TTC	Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and [NAME], throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners.
TTC	“[NAME], [NAME], at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history.
TTC	When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him.
TTC	Did I say we could depend upon no better man?
TTC	“Truly, you did well,” said the [NAME], felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours.
TTC	But, there my [NAME] interposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that [NAME] and suffer those allusions.
TTC	The people closed round, and looked at [NAME] the [NAME].
TTC	Now comes the difference.
TTC	“May I ask, [NAME], if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest.
TTC	Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o’clock in the morning.
TTC	The moment [NAME] [NAME] took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop.
TTC	A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, [NAME] [NAME] was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
TTC	“My dear [NAME], it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind.
TTC	He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.
TTC	Two Promises  More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] was established in [NAME] as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police.
TTC	“I don’t know; I prefer not to do so.
TTC	Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
TTC	It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in [NAME] from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in [NAME], bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’”
TTC	“Is it possible!”
TTC	And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it!
TTC	The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone.
TTC	All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead.
TTC	“Have you written ‘forget them’?”
TTC	The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.
TTC	Casting his eyes over [NAME]’s letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at [NAME] with a close attention.
TTC	But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison.
TTC	You wouldn’t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you?
TTC	Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last [NAME].
TTC	“Do you suppose,” [NAME] [NAME] went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that [NAME] [NAME] has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?”
TTC	“Nor have [NAME]”  “If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man’s to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.”
TTC	“Remember?
TTC	The night deepened.
TTC	But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”
TTC	Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it.
TTC	Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
TTC	“‘We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior [NAME]--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!’
TTC	Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his shoulder.
TTC	But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with [NAME]’s.
TTC	He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of [NAME] downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of [NAME], through the portraits of every [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.
TTC	“My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation.
TTC	Let me think it out!”
TTC	“Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, [NAME]?”  “Nothing.”
TTC	Will you wake me?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], let me ask you a question.”
TTC	It was The [NAME] who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings.
TTC	For the moment.”
TTC	“There is no doubt of the [NAME]?” inquired [NAME] [NAME], letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.
TTC	He is quiet.
TTC	Within the carriage there.
TTC	“It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
TTC	“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Twelve gone for ever.
TTC	He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the [NAME], and stood quiet.
TTC	The key was put in the lock, and turned.
TTC	He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
TTC	“Will you answer me a single question?”
TTC	your [NAME], you know.”
TTC	“He lies!”
TTC	There is such an uneasiness in [NAME], that we have actually a run of confidence upon us!
TTC	When I left the village, [NAME] evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”
TTC	Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”
TTC	The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.
TTC	You may take it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], touching him affectionately on the arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine.
TTC	she cried, all at once.
TTC	Is your hand steady enough to write?”
TTC	There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together.
TTC	Are _you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good [NAME] [NAME]?”  “[NAME]’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned [NAME] [NAME], “I hope so.
TTC	“We shall not be separated long.
TTC	You will be visited, and can ask then.
TTC	Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”
TTC	It is out of the [NAME] and restoration you have brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?”
TTC	The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand.
TTC	[NAME] was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the [NAME]’s service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
TTC	The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side.
TTC	Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives and axes were sharp and bright, the [NAME]’s hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker’s stock was murderous.
TTC	Who moved uneasily on his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:  “Well!
TTC	They were only three at table, and [NAME] [NAME] made the third.
TTC	He already asks himself, “Has he sacrificed me?”
TTC	“[NAME],” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to [NAME], under an escort.”
TTC	Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey’s end.
TTC	“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], in her breathing.
TTC	Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here.
TTC	Likewise wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”
TTC	There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached.
TTC	“You were very sound, [NAME], in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day.
TTC	Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to [NAME], in a hushed [NAME]--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little [NAME], comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the tongues of the [NAME] [NAME] that were blended in her life.
TTC	There was life, and no more.
TTC	They were as silent, however, as the men.
TTC	muttered young [NAME].
TTC	It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under [NAME].
TTC	Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and [NAME] might have been warmer in his manner.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence.
TTC	Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
TTC	I will go to her.”
TTC	The [NAME] rarely answered to the actual tread of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	He was not of this part of the country.
TTC	It is madness.
TTC	[NAME] leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you mean?”
TTC	Have ’em out, there!
TTC	“As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise.
TTC	“Ah!” said [NAME], with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that away.
TTC	There may be many more, for all that he can say, but he knows of one.”
TTC	This was a courage that [NAME] [NAME] so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness.
TTC	The [NAME]  When the mail got successfully to [NAME], in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] opened the coach-door as his custom was.
TTC	There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and [NAME].
TTC	“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs.
TTC	As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
TTC	“It is well.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] poured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.
TTC	Do you play?”
TTC	It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it.
TTC	To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.
TTC	“You think not, sir?”
TTC	“Excuse me, as a persistent man of business.
TTC	Two score and twelve were told off.
TTC	“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question.
TTC	“Among us!”
TTC	the [NAME] desired to know.
TTC	[NAME] asked the postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.
TTC	and then counted up to twelve, and said, ‘Hush!’
TTC	He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “[NAME] [NAME]’s.”
TTC	“No,” said [NAME].
TTC	The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to [NAME]:  “Witnesses.”
TTC	The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the [NAME] spoke:  “--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake.
TTC	“To be registered?”
TTC	But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time.”
TTC	Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life.
TTC	“His goods,” said [NAME] [NAME], after turning it over in his mind, “is a branch of Scientific goods.”
TTC	Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
TTC	They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there.
TTC	“You remember the place, my father?
TTC	They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing.
TTC	The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.
TTC	For, going to the door of the Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench and tools were put aside again, and that the [NAME] himself sat reading at the window.
TTC	The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far behind, and [NAME], again escorted by the [NAME], was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau.
TTC	answered [NAME], drily.
TTC	I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her.
TTC	“That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”  said he, at his hoarsest.
TTC	From these decayed sons and daughters of [NAME], she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a [NAME], or [NAME]’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased.
TTC	Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, [NAME], and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring [NAME], the churches that are not my father’s house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
TTC	By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.
TTC	I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away.
TTC	Let me see her.
TTC	A singular circumstance then arose in the case.
TTC	The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you.
TTC	They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite.
TTC	[NAME], still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be astonished?”
TTC	D--n the fellow!”
TTC	A faint voice answered something.
TTC	“Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what harm--if his door was left open.”
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], then!”  “[NAME] [NAME], then!”
TTC	“[NAME]!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.
TTC	If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand.”
TTC	The story of his pure soul was exactly what [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] had described it to be--perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly.
TTC	That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late [NAME], [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.
TTC	“What do you mean?”
TTC	It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it.
TTC	“I did so, raising the boy’s head against my knee.
TTC	They are worth no more than that.”
TTC	She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting: “Hah!
TTC	Never, if [NAME] [NAME] knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs!
TTC	“He is right there, [NAME],” murmured [NAME], to him who had interrupted.
TTC	[NAME], with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.
TTC	The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me.
TTC	[NAME] had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the [NAME] [NAME] suburb.
TTC	To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.
TTC	“[NAME]?” cried the blatant [NAME].
TTC	It was the elder who replied, ‘Since about this hour last night.’
TTC	“To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.
TTC	asked the younger brother.
TTC	I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted [NAME] [NAME], “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”
TTC	By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface.
TTC	With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for [NAME] [NAME]; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting [NAME] ever arose among the people out of all the working of the [NAME]; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; [NAME] [NAME] crossed the [NAME] again for the lighter streets.
TTC	And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, [NAME] [NAME], unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for.
TTC	“If I could hope _that_, my father!--”  “Believe it, love!
TTC	“What did you say?”
TTC	A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
TTC	The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, “[NAME].”
TTC	“What is it?”
TTC	your mother’s a nice woman, young [NAME], going a praying agin your father’s prosperity.
TTC	He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.
TTC	To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I meet no dinner anywhere.”
TTC	“[NAME]--a matter of business.
TTC	You speak faintly.”
TTC	Look at it.
TTC	“It is what I meant to say.”
TTC	the latter whispered.
TTC	“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground.
TTC	In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it.
TTC	“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”  said his late client, taking his hand.
TTC	I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart.
TTC	The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them.
TTC	The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.
TTC	The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check.
TTC	He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.
TTC	A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood.
TTC	“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
TTC	“To no one.”
TTC	Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ [NAME], or got undeserved promotion in it!
TTC	They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night.
TTC	Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’ two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?”
TTC	Here’s an early job to begin with!”
TTC	Altogether, the [NAME] [NAME], at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
TTC	“Thérèse [NAME], his wife.”
TTC	Forbid it as we shouldn’t all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal risk!
TTC	All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.
TTC	You know I have been drinking.”
TTC	“But ask yourself the question now.”
TTC	If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the [NAME]’s case.
TTC	He was so much too big for [NAME]’s, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall.
TTC	Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.
TTC	she whispered.
TTC	“You had better, [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our good [NAME].
TTC	But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way.
TTC	Every pulse and heart in [NAME] [NAME] was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
TTC	Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them always.
TTC	“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the [NAME], smiling.
TTC	“I hope,” said [NAME] [NAME], after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, “that you accompany [NAME] [NAME] to [NAME]?”
TTC	But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread.
TTC	A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of [NAME]’s [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet.
TTC	“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.
TTC	They left her at the corner of the street, and [NAME] led the way to [NAME] [NAME][NAME], which was within a few minutes’ walk.
TTC	“[NAME] me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
TTC	His hand was again upon the window.
TTC	In the black prison of the [NAME], the doomed of the day awaited their fate.
TTC	On a day in [NAME], when [NAME] [NAME] (after notifying to his jackal that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his delicacy into [NAME], and when the sight and scent of flowers in the [NAME] streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, [NAME]’s feet still trod those stones.
TTC	“Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said [NAME] the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back.
TTC	He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], look upon the prisoner.
TTC	Enough; you are [NAME]; that is another thing.
TTC	His touch still lingered on her father’s hand.
TTC	But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.”
TTC	softly over the coach roof.
TTC	“You are fatigued.
TTC	The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.
TTC	I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions.
TTC	“Touch then.”
TTC	To [NAME] [NAME], he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.
TTC	With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.
TTC	Frantic acclamations were again raised.
TTC	“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half.”
TTC	the guard retorted.
TTC	“I cannot undertake to say that he was.”
TTC	“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store the lightning?
TTC	Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”
TTC	“And you?” said the uncle.
TTC	What’s it about?”
TTC	To him, now entered [NAME] [NAME], at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
TTC	He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to [NAME].
TTC	“Didn’t you?
TTC	One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her.
TTC	She had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table.
TTC	The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind.
TTC	It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from [NAME] to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted.
TTC	It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:
TTC	“Swinging by the chain?
TTC	As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for [NAME]--which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of [NAME] never troubled it.
TTC	He wishes to see the fine world--the [NAME], the [NAME], and [NAME]; let him see them on [NAME].”
TTC	“Keep near to me, [NAME] [NAME],” cried Defarge; “and do you, [NAME] One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can.
TTC	“She has a fine head for it,” croaked [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	It is [NAME] [NAME] who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door, replying to a group of officials.
TTC	Sounding [NAME] [NAME], and finding him of her opinion, [NAME] [NAME] resorted to the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME], attended by her cavalier.
TTC	“For gracious sake, don’t talk about [NAME]; we have quite enough of that,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs.
TTC	You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
TTC	“I’ll hear what you have got to say.
TTC	“You can bear a little more light?”
TTC	[NAME] was the first stranger to whom little [NAME] held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew.
TTC	But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of [NAME] [NAME] it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.
TTC	The [NAME] of [NAME]  [NAME] [NAME] having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the [NAME]’s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.
TTC	“Then be so kind,” urged [NAME] [NAME], “as to leave us here.
TTC	An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
TTC	“Long ago.”
TTC	You’ve been at [NAME] [NAME]’s house as much as I have, or more than I have.
TTC	Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room.
TTC	Rain was really falling in large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it.
TTC	He recovered himself almost instantly.
TTC	You can hear that, miss?”
TTC	In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.”
TTC	He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to shun.
TTC	Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful.
TTC	“A pretty pattern too!”
TTC	He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way.
TTC	The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned [NAME] [NAME] and his devouring hunger far away.
TTC	Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.
TTC	If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.
TTC	There is a curse on it, and on all this land.”
TTC	But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that [NAME] [NAME] felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.
TTC	According to its nature.
TTC	As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.
TTC	It’s a fight to get back again.
TTC	Let us go on.”
TTC	I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night.
TTC	Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME], along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.
TTC	There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over.
TTC	“In the beginning of the great days, when the [NAME] falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp.
TTC	He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
TTC	It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down.
TTC	Tell me what it is.”
TTC	I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense.
TTC	Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way.
TTC	[NAME] at last found them before the wall of [NAME].
TTC	“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.
TTC	She cared nothing for you.”
TTC	Though it is to a prisoner in the [NAME].”
TTC	The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as [NAME] [NAME] spies, and wreaking vengeance on them.
TTC	That’s good comfort.
TTC	Hundreds of People  The quiet lodgings of [NAME] [NAME] were in a quiet street-corner not far from [NAME]-[NAME].
TTC	Darkness encompassed them.
TTC	That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his [NAME]’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.
TTC	Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody’s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
TTC	With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.
TTC	For, it must be recorded, that not only was [NAME] [NAME] lost in amazement and agitation, but, [NAME] [NAME]--though it seemed on his own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.
TTC	In the meanwhile, the [NAME] had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on [NAME] [NAME]’s return, he slipped away to his bench.
TTC	As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer’s face.
TTC	At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done any good, and never will.”
TTC	[NAME], sir!--And, my dear [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], glancing at the [NAME] again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of [NAME] at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME] at home?”
TTC	The name of the strong man of [NAME] [NAME] had descended to the chief [NAME] who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of [NAME]’s own [NAME] every day.
TTC	[NAME] is my witness that I love her!”
TTC	“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling [NAME], as he paused for a last moment.
TTC	Thus it had come to pass, that [NAME]’s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience.
TTC	“The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life.
TTC	My [NAME] inquired of [NAME] [NAME] (the prisoner’s counsel), whether they were next to try [NAME] [NAME] (name of my learned friend) for treason?
TTC	“I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence.
TTC	Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures.
TTC	Which is she?”
TTC	A quainter corner than the corner where the [NAME] lived, was not to be found in [NAME].
TTC	I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck.
TTC	I will write too, and--But stay!
TTC	I can’t afford it.
TTC	The [NAME] rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in [NAME]?
TTC	“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.”
TTC	Let me but lift my finger--!”
TTC	In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman’s.
TTC	The discreet [NAME] [NAME] said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, [NAME] [NAME]?
TTC	The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the [NAME] fountain.
TTC	“You?” said the [NAME] nervously.
TTC	“I know nothing of it.”
TTC	Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the [NAME] [NAME], as the women sat knitting, knitting.
TTC	Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces.
TTC	Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--[NAME].
TTC	It would not enable Her to go to see him.
TTC	He was delivered to you.
TTC	Then the strong-rooms underground, at [NAME]’s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
TTC	The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
TTC	After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into [NAME]’s down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from [NAME]-[NAME], and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Yet such things were.
TTC	She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.
TTC	“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow.
TTC	The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.
TTC	[NAME]’s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife.
TTC	“But there are no such decrees yet?”
TTC	So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain.
TTC	“Not at all.
TTC	It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart.
TTC	“Hallo you!”
TTC	But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.”
TTC	The [NAME] mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two [NAME] that they were not fit for the journey.
TTC	He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of [NAME] [NAME]’s head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.
TTC	At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Which [NAME]-[NAME], carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior mankind of the blood of [NAME], who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
TTC	“Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”
TTC	He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it.
TTC	“[NAME]!” said the [NAME] again, in a well-satisfied manner.
TTC	repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.
TTC	“I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give.
TTC	The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown.
TTC	Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”
TTC	Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done.
TTC	“It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary.
TTC	“‘We have been to your residence,’ said the first, ‘and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you.
TTC	“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”
TTC	“Long live the [NAME]!
TTC	How high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in [NAME] directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times.
TTC	He resented [NAME] [NAME]’s saying grace with particular animosity.
TTC	There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth.
TTC	When this interchange of Christian name was effected, [NAME] [NAME], picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
TTC	Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door.
TTC	Now if this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was [NAME]”  “The little child was a daughter, sir.”
TTC	“[NAME], I desire nothing more than to get to [NAME], though I could dispense with the escort.”
TTC	The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away.
TTC	“He knows nothing,” said [NAME]; “at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height.
TTC	The bill being paid, [NAME] [NAME] rose and wished him good night.
TTC	We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt [NAME] and [NAME], sir.
TTC	“No; I am not armed.”
TTC	They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts.
TTC	So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
TTC	All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there.
TTC	he said, “I am not worth such feeling, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“‘You know, [NAME], that it is among the [NAME] of these [NAME] to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us.
TTC	He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from [NAME]’s for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.
TTC	A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood.
TTC	“I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”
TTC	“I begin to think I _am_ [NAME].”
TTC	“He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.”
TTC	Presently, the dock became the central point of interest.
TTC	“Call wine, wine; and finish there.”
TTC	“You speak like a [NAME].”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and [NAME] [NAME] made his way to the outside of the bar.
TTC	Now, [NAME] [NAME] kissed a good [NAME]; something new in thy family; remember it!
TTC	I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please [NAME]!
TTC	Please to go on.”
TTC	“I lighted on you, [NAME] [NAME], coming out of the prison of the [NAME] while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
TTC	My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of [NAME] there, and brought us here.
TTC	You may also tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them.
TTC	Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
TTC	The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand.
TTC	You are fatigued.
TTC	The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him.
TTC	He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.
TTC	Speak for yourself.”
TTC	[NAME] had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] only shook her head and wept in silence.
TTC	Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to [NAME]: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.
TTC	“What was it you said to me?”
TTC	What, in the name of the [NAME] of [NAME], own father to yourself, was you called at that time?”
TTC	“Forgive me if I notice that you are affected.
TTC	They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle.
TTC	She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.
TTC	It was not for his friend to abate that confidence.
TTC	Not seeing with precision what was very hard, [NAME] [NAME] shook his head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.
TTC	He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate.
TTC	“If I understand,” said the [NAME], in a subdued tone, “some mental [NAME]?”
TTC	This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
TTC	Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
TTC	He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him.
TTC	It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore.
TTC	“Rely upon the patriotic [NAME], dear citizeness.
TTC	As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.
TTC	“[NAME]!” said the [NAME], glancing round the luxurious room.
TTC	But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner’s hand, and it was his real grasp.
TTC	“Hold then!
TTC	Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman’s weakness, which was wonderful to see.
TTC	Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on [NAME] [NAME], extinguished the light, and went out.
TTC	In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads.
TTC	“I can’t say.”
TTC	Enough of me.”
TTC	We had better go in.”
TTC	“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”  retorted [NAME], “whether they drink your health or the [NAME] [NAME]’s.”
TTC	Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his mind.
TTC	“You are a little late, [NAME],” said [NAME].
TTC	“_I_ ask no questions and make no stipulations.
TTC	So does a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star.
TTC	[NAME] sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.”
TTC	Weep for her, then, and for me!
TTC	“It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm.
TTC	But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms.
TTC	We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”
TTC	“Oh dear me, [NAME]?” repeated [NAME], drawing back.
TTC	At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried:  “Not that, sir!
TTC	What he could save for the owners, he saved.
TTC	“Your age, [NAME]?”  “[NAME]-seven.”  “Married, [NAME]?”  “Yes.”
TTC	He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing.
TTC	“He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.
TTC	You are not going out, I hope?”
TTC	The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
TTC	It was obviously the weakness of the position.
TTC	For an instant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’
TTC	You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now.
TTC	My memory is circumstantial and unshaken.
TTC	Swear it was not true?
TTC	In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away.
TTC	They had the air of a rough tribunal; [NAME] One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; [NAME] [NAME], equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose;
TTC	“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”
TTC	A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether.
TTC	Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to [NAME]’s, [NAME] took up his station on this windy [NAME] morning, with young [NAME] standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the [NAME], to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose.
TTC	He sat her down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.
TTC	“Yours,” said the gaoler.
TTC	Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and [NAME] [NAME] did not press him.
TTC	She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that [NAME], near the [NAME]-house.
TTC	“_I_ don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, “[NAME]!
TTC	“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused [NAME] [NAME] to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in [NAME].
TTC	Armed men and women flocked out of the [NAME] so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in [NAME] [NAME]’s bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.
TTC	While his learned friend, [NAME] [NAME], massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my [NAME] himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day.
TTC	Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters.
TTC	How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in [NAME] [NAME]’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?
TTC	The buzz of the great flies was loud again.
TTC	They even whisper that because he has slain [NAME], and because [NAME] was the father of his tenants--[NAME]--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide.
TTC	All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.
TTC	The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done.
TTC	After a gloomy silence, the first [NAME] said, “Good!
TTC	“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair.
TTC	There’s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said [NAME] [NAME], “that I didn’t cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn’t see it.”
TTC	See what the prisoner is.
TTC	“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman.
TTC	The family honour, [NAME], is safe from me in this country.
TTC	In conjunction with [NAME] [NAME], he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the [NAME] was not well, and required a few days of complete rest.
TTC	“It is the daughter of your father who is my business here.”
TTC	The fashion of the last [NAME] but one, of the line that was never to break--the fourteenth [NAME]--was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of [NAME].
TTC	No; you have been the ward of [NAME]’s [NAME] since, and I have been busy with the other business of [NAME]’s [NAME] since.
TTC	Don’t be frightened!
TTC	Do you start for [NAME] from here?”
TTC	“Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?”
TTC	It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.
TTC	“With his hand in the girl’s?”
TTC	“They tell me so.”
TTC	I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note  from [NAME] to his wife.
TTC	His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”
TTC	I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him.
TTC	“What is to be told to [NAME]?
TTC	“I am glad of that.
TTC	“I can hear,” said [NAME] [NAME], seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing.
TTC	“Then what on earth is your meaning, [NAME] [NAME]?” demanded [NAME], perceptibly crestfallen.
TTC	He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was.
TTC	His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy.
TTC	Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, [NAME] [NAME]’s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew [NAME] [NAME] well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.
TTC	He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm.
TTC	“Here, in [NAME]?”  “Has been here some days--three or four--I don’t know how many--I can’t collect my thoughts.
TTC	These were its contents:  “[NAME] of the [NAME], [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME], the good [NAME] knows; but I don’t ask it.
TTC	“I will come back, to see you off.”
TTC	with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.
TTC	“Transparently!”
TTC	“[NAME]! [NAME]!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.
TTC	“Work, comrades all, work!
TTC	Well; but don’t cry,” said the gentle [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”
TTC	When he can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you.
TTC	For the rest, it is my [NAME].”
TTC	“What’s coming on?”
TTC	My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers.
TTC	“Quick to see what happened!
TTC	“Be a brave man, my [NAME]!
TTC	Looking that way, [NAME] [NAME] made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar.
TTC	The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness.
TTC	“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man.
TTC	“I recall it.”
TTC	It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.”
TTC	Ever been kicked?
TTC	They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”
TTC	“Now,” said [NAME] [NAME], gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm again, after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this attack?”
TTC	I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”
TTC	Ask him, is that so.”
TTC	“Afraid?”  “It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be.
TTC	“What was he like?”
TTC	I hope so.
TTC	“Hold the light higher!”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged [NAME] and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished [NAME], who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her.
TTC	“Yes, yes: better as it is.”
TTC	Hence [NAME] had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich [NAME]-[NAME], poor in family.
TTC	It proceeded from [NAME] [NAME], the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] at [NAME], and had since improved.
TTC	It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.
TTC	O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”
TTC	Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Almost at the same moment, the bell of the [NAME] gate [NAME] again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.
TTC	My meaning is that I am a man,” said [NAME], inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”
TTC	He put them, one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberately left the shop.
TTC	“You are a man of business and bound to have a reason.
TTC	“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.
TTC	The great grindstone, [NAME], had turned when [NAME] [NAME] looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard.
TTC	Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known.
TTC	It was the nephew of [NAME].
TTC	He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said he to [NAME]’s conductor, as he took a slip of paper to write on.
TTC	If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
TTC	“There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer.
TTC	He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at [NAME], and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at [NAME] and [NAME].
TTC	“May you prosper!”
TTC	Without returning the wish, [NAME] rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, [NAME] [NAME]: you think I am drunk?”
TTC	“What d’ye mean?
TTC	But, I was again taken and condemned.”
TTC	In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.
TTC	Now, my dear [NAME],” drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and [NAME] [NAME] and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear.
TTC	His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in [NAME]-[NAME] and the [NAME] of [NAME], that fine morning.
TTC	“When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health.
TTC	A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom [NAME] presented “The [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	The very children scarcely noticed him.
TTC	Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the [NAME] weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.
TTC	But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in [NAME]’s [NAME] were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.
TTC	All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
TTC	They went up slowly and softly.
TTC	He had now to attend while [NAME] [NAME] fitted the prisoner’s case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, [NAME], was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed [NAME]--which he certainly did look rather like.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME]’s brother, sir,” said [NAME].
TTC	It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process.
TTC	That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence.
TTC	“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”
TTC	“Is he always alone, then?”
TTC	The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”  “[NAME],” was [NAME] [NAME]’s not unreasonable reply, “at the commencement.”
TTC	And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.
TTC	Does his daughter know of the relapse?”
TTC	The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
TTC	“I hope you care to live?”
TTC	“I heard you were released, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said [NAME], “and come out, if you want to speak to me.
TTC	Hunger was the inscription on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale.
TTC	I remember them very well.”
TTC	The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold.
TTC	I expect nothing!
TTC	He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh.
TTC	I don’t say it is--wot I would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this.
TTC	That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well.
TTC	[NAME] was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places.
TTC	But, [NAME] sat all day at her counter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her.
TTC	“[NAME],” said another voice, striking in.
TTC	He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
TTC	In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work.
TTC	[NAME], our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
TTC	He had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress.
TTC	Whether it was alive.
TTC	Was he one of those two passengers?”
TTC	Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.
TTC	“I ask none, sir.
TTC	“You cannot see him, my poor dear?”
TTC	Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, like a distracted child.
TTC	Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.
TTC	Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it.
TTC	I own to you, I am shaken, [NAME] [NAME], by [NAME] [NAME]’s not having had the power to prevent this arrest.”
TTC	The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine.
TTC	He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
TTC	The young lady goes before all.”
TTC	There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”
TTC	These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.
TTC	She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed.
TTC	Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”
TTC	[NAME] motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him.
TTC	I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with [NAME] [NAME], except that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances.
TTC	At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.
TTC	My [NAME] will find a place for me.
TTC	Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences.
TTC	“What o’clock do you make it, [NAME]?”
TTC	“Shall we go home, my father?”
TTC	This mode of address was now prescribed by decree.
TTC	He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart.
TTC	The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, “Long live the [NAME]!”
TTC	While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of [NAME]’s [NAME], by [NAME] [NAME], who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_
TTC	I know you.
TTC	He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand.
TTC	She did not greatly alter in appearance.
TTC	It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young [NAME], and was put together again when the occasion wanted it.
TTC	(Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.)
TTC	“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his answer--“various business.”
TTC	It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.
TTC	The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last.
TTC	“Don’t fear me.
TTC	You might have used your talents better.”
TTC	it’s not important--No, it’s not important.
TTC	No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the [NAME], never reverses his transformations.
TTC	As [NAME] walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent [NAME]) for a small measure of wine, [NAME] [NAME] cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.
TTC	“The crime for which I am imprisoned, [NAME] heretofore the [NAME], and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant.
TTC	But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly.
TTC	The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden.
TTC	The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], and [NAME] [NAME], were left quite alone.
TTC	As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and [NAME] in the dominant prison on the crag.
TTC	A [NAME]  [NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life.
TTC	I saw her pass me on the road.
TTC	“What was that?”
TTC	“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”
TTC	[NAME] then sees the [NAME], and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.
TTC	It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man.
TTC	“At a little after midnight.”
TTC	And he turned his face towards [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty.
TTC	There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of [NAME]; where is she?”
TTC	At which juncture, he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:  “[NAME] me, if she ain’t at it agin!”
TTC	Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.
TTC	And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.
TTC	Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?
TTC	Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.
TTC	[NAME] was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company.
TTC	Your honour told me to call you.”
TTC	Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to [NAME]’s, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren.
TTC	(“I really think this must be a man!”
TTC	Have no imagination at all.”
TTC	“Upon my life,” said [NAME], smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours.
TTC	“What is that?”
TTC	“[NAME], no, no; you are too young, too blooming.
TTC	It was dated from [NAME] [NAME], within an hour.
TTC	“Nothing at all, [NAME].”
TTC	“You have a visitor, you see,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“I knew it.
TTC	Back to the [NAME], and Death within four-and-twenty hours!
TTC	“And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued [NAME] [NAME], “before you were put in your cradle.”
TTC	I attended him in his last illness.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from [NAME]’s, who had looked into the red coals at the [NAME] [NAME] at [NAME], now a good many years ago.
TTC	“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson.
TTC	“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.”
TTC	“It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders.
TTC	Many suffer with it.
TTC	Both [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining.
TTC	The hour had measured like most other hours.
TTC	With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
TTC	They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
TTC	Beginning to be struck by [NAME]’s manner, [NAME] [NAME] looked dubiously at him, and led the way.
TTC	A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”
TTC	“[NAME], eh?” repeated [NAME], musing, and not appearing to notice him at all, though he echoed his word.
TTC	Whether it had been born alive, or the poor mother’s shock had killed it.
TTC	“Enough!” said [NAME], with grim impatience.
TTC	My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in [NAME] with my dear daughter here.
TTC	“[NAME]!” cried [NAME] [NAME], rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am shocked at the sight of you.”
TTC	Put your hands to them; put your will to them.
TTC	There was something in its touch that gave [NAME] a check.
TTC	“No.”  “So at least you say he may have been one of them?”
TTC	“But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day.
TTC	Is not that my right?”
TTC	“[NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of business.
TTC	“[NAME], a perfect [NAME]!
TTC	[NAME] who told the starving people they might eat grass!
TTC	We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!”
TTC	Says it with his head on!”
TTC	The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer’s breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure.
TTC	“I am cool now,” said [NAME] the [NAME], “and may go to bed.”
TTC	On the night of the day on which he left the house, [NAME] [NAME] went into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by [NAME] [NAME] carrying a light.
TTC	and they bring him faster.
TTC	Therefore when the [NAME] said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the [NAME] would deserve better still of the [NAME] by rooting out an obnoxious family of [NAME], and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy.
TTC	I distress you; I draw fast to an end.
TTC	Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction.
TTC	When is it dated?
TTC	“Listen once again then, [NAME]!” said the man with the restless hand and the craving air.
TTC	In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital.
TTC	I hope _you_ are pretty well!”
TTC	This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
TTC	He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head.
TTC	At heart and by descent an [NAME], an enemy of the [NAME], a notorious oppressor of the [NAME].
TTC	Look at me!”
TTC	“I bring you a request from her.”
TTC	“A moment more.”
TTC	Among the talkers, was [NAME], of the [NAME]’s [NAME] [NAME], far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to [NAME], his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race.
TTC	[NAME]’s had whitewashed the [NAME], but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the [NAME] linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to night.
TTC	If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread.
TTC	As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell.
TTC	“[NAME], [NAME]; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.”
TTC	“I will do so.
TTC	[NAME] the [NAME] in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill.
TTC	A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away.
TTC	“Ay! and condemned as a traitor.”
TTC	“This is [NAME]!” said he.
TTC	My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”
TTC	He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him.
TTC	The preceding relative positions of himself and [NAME] were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him.
TTC	He was buried in [NAME], at the church of [NAME] [NAME]-in-the-[NAME].
TTC	Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!”
TTC	His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position.
TTC	Every question told.”
TTC	His practised eye saw it, and made the most of it.
TTC	He said it with an involuntary shudder.
TTC	“My father,” said [NAME], softly laying her hand on his.
TTC	The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful.
TTC	“Why, then,” said [NAME] [NAME], grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side.”
TTC	As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
TTC	If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done.
TTC	She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she.
TTC	Pull off gentleman’s boots in [NAME].
TTC	“I am going to tell you how.
TTC	I hope to do my part faithfully.”
TTC	“Well, well!
TTC	His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
TTC	With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it.
TTC	His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
TTC	And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.
TTC	“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“No, I cannot spare him!
TTC	In this respect the [NAME] was much on a par with the [NAME]; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.
TTC	The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the [NAME], there was a general set of the current of talkers past [NAME] [NAME]’s desk.
TTC	“Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”
TTC	“That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate.
TTC	The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of [NAME] the [NAME], one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
TTC	But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?”
TTC	“I believe so.”
TTC	“Who wants me?
TTC	The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the [NAME], was now the news-[NAME], and was filled to overflowing.
TTC	What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside.
TTC	That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”
TTC	Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes.
TTC	But he lives unknown in [NAME], he is no [NAME] there; he is [NAME] [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, ‘I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’
TTC	On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.
TTC	“We have new laws, [NAME], and new offences, since you were here.”
TTC	“But may not--mind!
TTC	To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued, he said: “Removed to the [NAME], and summoned for to-morrow?”  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted.
TTC	“‘See, gentlemen,’ said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, ‘how useless I am, as you have brought me!
TTC	Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved.
TTC	[NAME] (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years.
TTC	[NAME] (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, [NAME] as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this.
TTC	On the road (except at [NAME]) he had heard absolutely nothing.
TTC	He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.
TTC	False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep.
TTC	“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”
TTC	In the church and at the [NAME], a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.
TTC	In the evening, at which season of all others [NAME] [NAME] turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, [NAME] [NAME] with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a [NAME]--there were many like her--such as the world will do well never to breed again.
TTC	He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time.
TTC	“_I_ say a horse at a [NAME], [NAME],” returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place.
TTC	There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] put this provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and [NAME] [NAME] roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.
TTC	“I was only saying my prayers.”
TTC	Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse.
TTC	My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”
TTC	“And I am very happy to-night, dear father.
TTC	Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.
TTC	He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”
TTC	“You think there never might have been a [NAME] [NAME]?” asked the gentleman of that name.
TTC	Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:  “Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part.
TTC	“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”
TTC	For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition.
TTC	The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square.
TTC	He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps [NAME] [NAME] might gain almost as great a name in history as [NAME] the [NAME].
TTC	It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”
TTC	“For the love of [NAME], of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, [NAME] heretofore the [NAME], to succour and release me.
TTC	When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows.
TTC	“Influence; he says something touching influence?”
TTC	For his daughter’s sake, my dear [NAME]!”
TTC	“Surely, surely.”
TTC	“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead.
TTC	I am not unwilling to die, if the [NAME] which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and that the rain had startled him.
TTC	“It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”
TTC	When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--“Like me.”
TTC	“So _you_ put him in his coffin?”
TTC	“Your husband is not my business here,” returned [NAME] [NAME], looking down at her with perfect composure.
TTC	“At [NAME]’s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face.
TTC	“I think not.
TTC	It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as [NAME] [NAME] stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach.
TTC	Drawn to the [NAME] [NAME]  In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore--three years of tempest were consumed.
TTC	We have to think of the [NAME] more than ourselves.”
TTC	“The [NAME] case.”
TTC	“Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said [NAME], wistfully.
TTC	“I salute you, citizen.”
TTC	This is she.
TTC	“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it is probably false.
TTC	His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the [NAME] was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in [NAME], always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the [NAME] government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of [NAME] and friend of the [NAME] [NAME]--as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the [NAME] and the populace became one.
TTC	He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me.
TTC	“Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me?
TTC	“Yes; for a walk with me.
TTC	For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at [NAME]’s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red.
TTC	It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified.
TTC	“It _is_ a thing to thank [NAME] for; is it not?”
TTC	“I’ll run them over.
TTC	Don’t look so horrified.
TTC	“To propose too much, would be to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced.
TTC	The amiable [NAME] added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith!
TTC	I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same.
TTC	The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”
TTC	He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at [NAME] [NAME]’s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the [NAME] [NAME] itself.
TTC	With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in [NAME] had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point.
TTC	You have seen the worst of her agitation.”
TTC	Some three years, or three years and a half ago.”
TTC	When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned.
TTC	“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”  Much interested and agitated, [NAME] [NAME] said: “You come from [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	“Come!” said [NAME].
TTC	Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated.
TTC	The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the [NAME].
TTC	On this post of his, [NAME] [NAME] was as well known to [NAME]-[NAME] and the [NAME], as the [NAME] itself,--and was almost as in-looking.
TTC	Thou wilt be faithful, little [NAME]?’
TTC	Ever been in prison?
TTC	“I go,” said madame, “with you at present.
TTC	“How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	[NAME] raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too.
TTC	“That’s all, messieurs.
TTC	In [NAME]’s name why should you kneel to me!”
TTC	It was a poorer hand than he suspected.
TTC	Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the [NAME].
TTC	Accordingly, when [NAME] [NAME] called that night as late as ten o’clock, [NAME] [NAME], among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning.
TTC	As if [NAME] [NAME] had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in [NAME], that this precious brother had spent her money and left her!
TTC	“[NAME] if I know that either,” said [NAME].
TTC	There was no one bidden to the marriage but [NAME] [NAME]; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show.
TTC	The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even [NAME]’s, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time.
TTC	As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the [NAME], the first [NAME] of [NAME], or the richest merchant in [NAME].
TTC	He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them.
TTC	[NAME], who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to [NAME]:  “This is a strange chance that throws you and me together.
TTC	Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire.
TTC	To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of [NAME]’s burial, which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, “ever since.
TTC	All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”
TTC	I tell thee it is always advancing.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.
TTC	the spy asked.
TTC	A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him.
TTC	This is idle talk.”
TTC	He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead.
TTC	“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day--work.”
TTC	And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.
TTC	On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his “[NAME] [NAME] Guillotine”--for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised.
TTC	“The time is short, [NAME],” said the [NAME], in a warning voice.
TTC	I am like one who died young.
TTC	I believe it.”
TTC	“No.”  “Nor written?”  “Never.”
TTC	Oh dear no.
TTC	The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, [NAME]. [NAME], sir?”
TTC	[NAME] and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread.
TTC	The virtuous servant, [NAME] [NAME], swore his way through the case at a great rate.
TTC	It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old [NAME] night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.
TTC	The [NAME] returned immediately, with two men.
TTC	[NAME] had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, [NAME] had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way--tend to his own power and pocket.
TTC	“Then I tell you again, [NAME] [NAME], I am sorry for it.
TTC	So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.
TTC	[NAME] brought him the wine, and gave him [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	muttered her husband.
TTC	The parting interview has overpowered me.
TTC	What have they done with my work?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in.
TTC	(There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.)
TTC	She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child.
TTC	You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!”
TTC	The great bell of [NAME] [NAME]’s was striking one in the cleared air, when [NAME] [NAME], escorted by [NAME], high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his return-passage to [NAME].
TTC	And not for money.
TTC	[NAME] coming, and the [NAME] not returning, and every minute’s delay tending to compromise [NAME]’s, [NAME] [NAME] advised with [NAME].
TTC	The prisoner looked up, at each question.
TTC	“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen?
TTC	That is not my name.
TTC	So we are not much alike in that particular.
TTC	“Is it possible!”
TTC	The [NAME] rang his bell; but, The [NAME], warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that bell!”
TTC	the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar.
TTC	“It is so,” assented [NAME], without being asked.
TTC	Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the [NAME] [NAME], else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.
TTC	“Yes, unhappily.”
TTC	“[NAME], he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, [NAME], [NAME], and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
TTC	And look at me!
TTC	“I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her light.
TTC	And a beautiful world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day.
TTC	But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible.
TTC	These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, [NAME] [NAME] took in the hope of his coming to himself.
TTC	I don’t know.”
TTC	At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a [NAME] and a new large figure of Our [NAME] on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was dreadfully spare and thin.
TTC	He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him.
TTC	The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid.
TTC	He was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn.
TTC	It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as “a honest tradesman.”
TTC	After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] to squeeze himself into court.
TTC	The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness.
TTC	I examine it, very closely.
TTC	If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, [NAME] [NAME], there?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had begun, when [NAME] [NAME] took him up short with:  “Never imagine anything.
TTC	Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that [NAME] [NAME] and [NAME], who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
TTC	Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, [NAME] [NAME], whether it is good for [NAME] [NAME] to have that suppression always shut up within him.
TTC	He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it.
TTC	The [NAME] stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.
TTC	Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met the same fate.
TTC	Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all events--out of [NAME].
TTC	“That’s the name for a thousand pound!”
TTC	she laughed, “you poor wretch!
TTC	“A great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!”
TTC	“Well!” said [NAME], slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you, [NAME] [NAME], I’ll be hanged!”
TTC	On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the [NAME] and prison-sheep.
TTC	What does he send me?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee.
TTC	In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
TTC	The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.
TTC	Am I to kiss you now?
TTC	“That there [NAME] [NAME], master,” said [NAME] [NAME], with a taciturn and iron-bound visage.
TTC	People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls.
TTC	We know, now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it.
TTC	As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets.
TTC	There it is.
TTC	The [NAME] looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.
TTC	You are a turnkey at the [NAME]?”
TTC	As [NAME] [NAME] received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.
TTC	“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME]; “and that was my brother [NAME], if he hadn’t made a mistake in life.”
TTC	“Be careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me.”
TTC	If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
TTC	With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints.
TTC	Another and another.
TTC	In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay.
TTC	“Good day, [NAME]!”
TTC	“You are happy, my dear father?”
TTC	The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse.
TTC	Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.
TTC	He also referred with confidence to the citizen’s letter, which had been taken from him at the [NAME], but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the [NAME].
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” she said, touching him with her cold hand.
TTC	And still [NAME] [NAME], pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and [NAME].
TTC	Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for [NAME]’s ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong.
TTC	A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The [NAME].
TTC	From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to [NAME].
TTC	“You will not be late?”
TTC	“Now understand me,” pursued [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	And then they began to fish.
TTC	It was in vain that I asked her for her family name.
TTC	After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.
TTC	Now, [NAME], never you stir from that fire till I come back!
TTC	After what has happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again.
TTC	Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?”
TTC	She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.
TTC	“Yes; for a moment.
TTC	The gaoler standing at his side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost.
TTC	Very well, very well.”
TTC	“Not at all, but I hope to know it better.
TTC	[NAME] ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.
TTC	“Entreat me to believe it no more, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling.
TTC	“He is [NAME].”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME], walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s side along sunny and crowded [NAME]-street, was a very different [NAME] [NAME] from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer.
TTC	I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you.
TTC	That is your consolation.
TTC	We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds.
TTC	That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before.
TTC	“[NAME], I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking [NAME] for my great happiness.
TTC	“‘I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them.
TTC	Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall.
TTC	Such a poor weak little creature!”
TTC	Death is [NAME]’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?
TTC	They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
TTC	He was a true [NAME], and hoped there were many like him.
TTC	“Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue.
TTC	Have I had nothing more important to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”
TTC	A happy circumstance for [NAME], as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!--always was for [NAME] (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry [NAME] who sold it.
TTC	I decided, that day, to write privately to the [NAME], stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances.
TTC	Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.  [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Never!” said [NAME] [NAME], who understood the request as perfectly as [NAME] [NAME] understood the answer.
TTC	With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.
TTC	“I received a letter from the [NAME], [NAME], yesterday, informing me that some intelligence--or [NAME]”  “The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”
TTC	“How did it show itself?
TTC	“No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said the [NAME].
TTC	“Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed.”
TTC	You want to be the death of me.
TTC	He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.
TTC	Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
TTC	Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death’s dominion.
TTC	He was to be told (said [NAME]) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to it.
TTC	If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water.
TTC	Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half [NAME], that nothing could be better.
TTC	“If you come to advancing you know,” said [NAME] [NAME], delighted to be able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”
TTC	As before, he repeated, “Out?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was nearly at his side; [NAME] [NAME], still heading some of her women, was visible in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand.
TTC	Her husband’s step was strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal.
TTC	“What,” said [NAME], still only half turned towards him, “do you expect, [NAME] [NAME]?”
TTC	The [NAME] clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the [NAME] principal opened the door.
TTC	Kiss our child for me.”
TTC	I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers.
TTC	“He is a traitor since the decree.
TTC	[NAME] had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling.
TTC	He was happy in the return he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength.
TTC	“It’s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest.
TTC	“It is enough that you return straight to the [NAME], and will know to-morrow.
TTC	It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd.
TTC	That was before my time here, [NAME].
TTC	And we seldom have a child there.
TTC	But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison.
TTC	“Draw on these boots of mine.
TTC	This being another question hard to answer, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] withdrew to consider it.
TTC	His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn.
TTC	And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs.
TTC	“You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said [NAME] [NAME], looking steadfastly at him.
TTC	“Eh well!” returned madame.
TTC	Let me look.”
TTC	But, [NAME] [NAME], oblivion is not so easy to me, as you represent it to be to you.
TTC	“Not exactly so.
TTC	His way taking him past [NAME]’s, and he both banking at [NAME]’s and knowing [NAME] [NAME] as the intimate friend of the [NAME], it entered [NAME] [NAME]’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to [NAME] [NAME] the brightness of the [NAME] horizon.
TTC	*****  “I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative.
TTC	Of his pleasures, general and particular, [NAME] had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them.
TTC	As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her.
TTC	I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph.
TTC	What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young [NAME]?
TTC	Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there.
TTC	“What purpose?”
TTC	But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not?
TTC	He is alive.
TTC	“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd.
TTC	That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to them.
TTC	The [NAME] grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind.
TTC	As a consequence, country airs circulated in [NAME] with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the [NAME] like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.
TTC	They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the [NAME] garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.
TTC	She resumed her knitting and went out.
TTC	He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”
TTC	[NAME], in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, [NAME] [NAME] got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red.
TTC	How do I know what injury you have done my horses.
TTC	The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the [NAME] considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.
TTC	The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril.
TTC	What do you say now?”
TTC	“For which side?”  “[NAME].”  “Against what side?”  “The prisoner’s.”
TTC	He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him.
TTC	“Say no more now.
TTC	“I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine.
TTC	“There is nothing to apprehend.
TTC	Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice?
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.
TTC	But when I think of my husband, and the mercies of these people--”  “We will set him above their mercies very soon.
TTC	bawled this figure, addressing the [NAME] servants.
TTC	It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement.
TTC	“A matter of business.
TTC	Now, good bye!”
TTC	Now, does he do too much?”
TTC	Why wouldn’t you go?”
TTC	“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways.
TTC	“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in [NAME].”
TTC	“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.
TTC	The [NAME] looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.
TTC	“By the cathedral door,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate [NAME] of [NAME] had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these.
TTC	All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me.
TTC	the [NAME] entreats him, timidly.
TTC	“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, [NAME] [NAME], that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so.
TTC	“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said [NAME] [NAME], wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan.
TTC	At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
TTC	But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.
TTC	“I hardly seem yet,” returned [NAME] [NAME], “to belong to this world again.”
TTC	Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
TTC	It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street.
TTC	“The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away.
TTC	“I have thought so before now.
TTC	“Are you sure,” asked [NAME] [NAME], of [NAME], “that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register?
TTC	A second man got up and went out.
TTC	Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”
TTC	Now, [NAME] defeat the fancy of [NAME] [NAME], and keep these feet far out of her life!
TTC	“I’ll think of it,” said [NAME].
TTC	“Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	I say this, because what I must bid you to do for [NAME]’s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all.
TTC	The [NAME], from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.
TTC	But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.
TTC	The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords.
TTC	Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the [NAME] to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against.
TTC	Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there [NAME] [NAME] let him go--as a cat might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth.
TTC	There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.
TTC	The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post.
TTC	The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets.
TTC	It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it.
TTC	and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.
TTC	She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he sat.
TTC	With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.
TTC	“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.
TTC	I rejoice to see you.
TTC	Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick.
TTC	Him, [NAME] heard with a particular feeling of objection; and [NAME] stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.
TTC	cried [NAME] [NAME], “to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.”
TTC	“This property and [NAME] are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I renounce them.”
TTC	“[NAME] the last post.
TTC	“Behold your papers, [NAME] [NAME], countersigned.”
TTC	That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one.
TTC	He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”
TTC	B-u-u-ust me!” said [NAME] [NAME], who all this time had been putting on his clothes, “if I ain’t, what with piety and one blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with!
TTC	The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when [NAME] [NAME]’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes.
TTC	“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to [NAME] [NAME] as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be arranged for our leaving [NAME] at once, so that, from the very door, he could be taken [NAME]”  “But, consider.
TTC	“I have seen them.
TTC	He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in [NAME], save those he had resigned; whereas, in [NAME], he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
TTC	And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.
TTC	What is to become of us, if those shoes are not done to-night?”  Lost, utterly lost!
TTC	Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him.
TTC	Yes,” was the grim reply of [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night.
TTC	But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness.
TTC	“That was a rare point, [NAME], that you brought to bear upon the identification.
TTC	You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye.”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.
TTC	“If you had sent the message, ‘Recalled to [NAME],’ again,” muttered [NAME], as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”
TTC	An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.
TTC	“Now, as to the future,” hinted [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Ah, confound you!
TTC	We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again.
TTC	[NAME] ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner.
TTC	“Ask who is arrived.”
TTC	The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost.
TTC	[NAME] and the three glanced darkly at one another.
TTC	“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him.”
TTC	Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more [NAME] and [NAME], more [NAME]’s [NAME], more lords and ladies, more Long live they all!
TTC	What was it?
TTC	In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner’s pockets, over and over again.
TTC	There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.
TTC	Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
TTC	They danced to the popular [NAME] song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
TTC	Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing.
TTC	It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the [NAME] closed.
TTC	“And now speak to your father, dearest.
TTC	[NAME] drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.
TTC	The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I always remember them.
TTC	I even believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”
TTC	He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears.
TTC	As yet, none.”
TTC	The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the [NAME] rang his bell to quiet them.
TTC	As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing.
TTC	“You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”
TTC	Two things at once impressed themselves on [NAME] [NAME], as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from [NAME]; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him.
TTC	It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables.
TTC	[NAME] was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
TTC	If it passed to me from you, to-morrow--”  “Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”
TTC	Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.
TTC	Oh, look at it, look at it!
TTC	So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where [NAME] [NAME] sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum.
TTC	Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME], “I wish we might be friends.”
TTC	Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.”
TTC	The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.
TTC	On a steaming, misty afternoon, [NAME] [NAME] sat at his desk, and [NAME] [NAME] stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.
TTC	He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage.
TTC	Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air.
TTC	All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire.
TTC	Where was his property?
TTC	The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the [NAME] [NAME] was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.
TTC	You know a compatriot who has found a [NAME] there?
TTC	There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.
TTC	“You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don’t mean any fashion of speech.
TTC	But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm [NAME] into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on [NAME] [NAME]’s dress:  “You will be good to my poor husband.
TTC	But the life I lead, [NAME] [NAME], is not conducive to health.
TTC	Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away.
TTC	This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business.
TTC	After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out.
TTC	She had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner.
TTC	He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.
TTC	Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny.
TTC	“Yes,” said [NAME].
TTC	A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, [NAME].
TTC	“Spare no detail.”
TTC	He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes.
TTC	The [NAME] gave him his hand.
TTC	“On the fourteenth.”
TTC	“But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange”--said Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, “that, after all our sympathy for [NAME] her father, and herself, her husband’s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by the side of that infernal dog’s who has just left us?”
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home.
TTC	She had become familiar to me, when a gracious [NAME] restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar.
TTC	from the uniform.
TTC	Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’ mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and [NAME]-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish.
TTC	Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the [NAME] stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest.
TTC	The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend.
TTC	Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”
TTC	A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the [NAME], denoted the approach of darkness.
TTC	As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there.
TTC	He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.
TTC	In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong.
TTC	When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase to their rooms.
TTC	Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”
TTC	I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day’s disfigurement--and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.
TTC	The place had a soothing influence on him.
TTC	To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME],” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now [NAME], now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being [NAME] that an [NAME] is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a [NAME], represents himself to his employers under a false name.
TTC	I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.”
TTC	Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?”
TTC	Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances.
TTC	“I know that, to be sure,” assented [NAME] [NAME], trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I am determined to be peevish after my long day’s botheration.
TTC	“Yes,” answered [NAME] [NAME]; “I have a good deal to do.”
TTC	said [NAME], squaring himself; “I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.
TTC	He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a [NAME] moving among mortals.
TTC	Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place.
TTC	“Do you think I particularly like you?”
TTC	‘Come on!’
TTC	And if you were, I won’t be took the liberty with.
TTC	“Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save [NAME]!
TTC	The pen dropped from [NAME]’s fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly.
TTC	In [NAME], there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting.
TTC	I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the [NAME] slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.”
TTC	In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, [NAME] [NAME] keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, [NAME] [NAME] never taking hers from the prisoner, [NAME] never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the [NAME], who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows.
TTC	“What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed [NAME] [NAME], rapturously.
TTC	Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once more.
TTC	“What do you say, [NAME]?”
TTC	“Walking here again, citizeness?”
TTC	So commences the new philosophy!
TTC	Mindful of the secret, [NAME] with great difficulty checked himself, and said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”
TTC	There could have been no such [NAME], if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the [NAME] was to scatter them all to the winds.
TTC	Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of [NAME], that the spies among the assembled devotees of [NAME]--forming a goodly half of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother.
TTC	This dialogue had taken place at [NAME] [NAME]’s usual desk, with [NAME] swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long.
TTC	I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.
TTC	“Go on then,” said [NAME].
TTC	Second: them poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere with [NAME] [NAME]’s flopping, never no more!”
TTC	“I intend to try.
TTC	Not to divide with [NAME] her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”
TTC	For scores of years gone by, [NAME] had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation [NAME] made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness.
TTC	I have no remembrance of the process.”
TTC	That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now.
TTC	“We all know you, [NAME] [NAME],” said the other three.
TTC	“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said [NAME] [NAME] to himself; “I don’t know you.”
TTC	“I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that [NAME] which I shall see no more.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], whom I expect; is he arrived from [NAME]?”
TTC	The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces.
TTC	Now, you know me; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men.
TTC	“And then breakfast, [NAME]?
TTC	[NAME] hoarsely professed himself at [NAME] [NAME]’s service.
TTC	They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire.
TTC	The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay.
TTC	I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them.”
TTC	Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and [NAME]; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea.
TTC	If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared.
TTC	How do you do, [NAME]?” and shook hands.
TTC	As I was telling you last night when [NAME] came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here.
TTC	If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided.
TTC	She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then, leaned over him, and looked at him.
TTC	“Don’t look out!
TTC	The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.’
TTC	In the [NAME]’s little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops.
TTC	That’s the kind of thing for _you_.
TTC	With his straw in his mouth, [NAME] [NAME] sat watching the two streams, like the [NAME] [NAME] who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream--saving that [NAME] had no expectation of their ever running dry.
TTC	Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap.
TTC	Is that a weapon in your hand?”
TTC	It is madness.”
TTC	She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with [NAME]’s friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.
TTC	“[NAME]!” he exclaimed.
TTC	I_ am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?”
TTC	Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”
TTC	It had its poor people too.
TTC	“It is frightful, messieurs.
TTC	It is represented that he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the [NAME].
TTC	Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in his letter through a trap in it.
TTC	All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning.
TTC	His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis.
TTC	To this lodging he at once removed [NAME] and her child, and [NAME] [NAME]: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
TTC	“I kiss your hand, miss,” said [NAME] [NAME], with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
TTC	About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the [NAME]’s bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.
TTC	They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend’s ashy face.
TTC	“Do you, by [NAME]?” said [NAME].
TTC	Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.
TTC	There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”  He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped.
TTC	Let us draw further back.
TTC	Upon that there stool, at that there [NAME], sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to be a man, [NAME] will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes.
TTC	[NAME] the [NAME] indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me!
TTC	In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep.
TTC	He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl.
TTC	He left [NAME] with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.
TTC	[NAME] bless me!
TTC	The [NAME] of the prisons turned from him to [NAME] [NAME], and said, with more decision, “It has come to a point.
TTC	Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.
TTC	[NAME], as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in [NAME], as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together.
TTC	He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even [NAME] [NAME], who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.
TTC	I had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour.
TTC	Congratulatory  From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when [NAME] [NAME], [NAME] [NAME], his daughter, [NAME] [NAME], the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, [NAME] [NAME], stood gathered round [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death.
TTC	Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
TTC	As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.
TTC	There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon?
TTC	If the [NAME] demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them.
TTC	“Stop!” said the [NAME] of [NAME].
TTC	I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the [NAME], near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.
TTC	They hanged at [NAME], in those days, so the street outside [NAME] had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
TTC	And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is [NAME] [NAME].”
TTC	“‘Pray excuse me,’ said [NAME] ‘Under the circumstances, no.’
TTC	Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the [NAME] of [NAME], and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank, and over the bridge, the [NAME] absorbed them every one and whirled them away.
TTC	The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together.
TTC	They began to descend; [NAME] [NAME] going first with the lamp, [NAME] [NAME] closing the little procession.
TTC	“Write exactly as I speak.”
TTC	First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
TTC	Your life is in your own hands.
TTC	“My love to [NAME], and to little [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME] at parting, “and take precious care of them till I come back.”
TTC	“I said so!
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped.
TTC	For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out.
TTC	Suffer them and forbid them not.
TTC	He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
TTC	I can’t sleep.”
TTC	“Indeed I am lost here.
TTC	“It is true what madame says,” observed [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day.
TTC	As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water.
TTC	So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting, counting dropping heads.
TTC	“I am very much put out about my [NAME].”
TTC	He opened it, and exclaimed, “Thank _[NAME]!_”  “What is it?” asked [NAME] [NAME], eagerly.
TTC	He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, and touched his lips.
TTC	“How do they call you?”
TTC	Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?
TTC	“Immediately after dark, I should hope.
TTC	The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest.
TTC	Is the teaboard still there, [NAME]?
TTC	“Yet once more!
TTC	Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in [NAME], to comfort her father.
TTC	Any person but this miserable fool, answer the [NAME] [NAME]!”
TTC	I hope you are well!”
TTC	That [NAME], however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his [NAME]’s [NAME] [NAME] of [NAME] and most honourable [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	“Where is my bench?
TTC	Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude.
TTC	Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”
TTC	To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
TTC	But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!”
TTC	In the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in your heart.
TTC	And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.
TTC	“I do it because it’s politic; I do it on principle.
TTC	Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another.”
TTC	[NAME]’s shall not be imposed upon.”
TTC	“And now we have done, [NAME], fill a bumper of punch,” said [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his length on the floor.
TTC	If I go to [NAME] [NAME]’s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?”
TTC	“After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!”
TTC	At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about [NAME], some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them.
TTC	([NAME] [NAME] himself always spoke of the year of our [NAME] as [NAME] [NAME]: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)
TTC	The gentleman from [NAME]’s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen [NAME] at the ears, and follow the waiter to [NAME] [NAME]’s apartment.
TTC	Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness.
TTC	Then he began grumbling again:  “With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink!
TTC	I thank you very gratefully.
TTC	“Hold!” cried [NAME], reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”
TTC	“[NAME], brother!” cried [NAME] [NAME], bursting into tears.
TTC	“Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to live no better life?”
TTC	That was another thing.
TTC	In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper.
TTC	“--rendered it necessary that I should go to [NAME], there to communicate with a gentleman of the [NAME], so good as to be despatched to [NAME] for the purpose.”
TTC	Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife.
TTC	“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to swallow a town.
TTC	“I am not afraid to die, [NAME] [NAME], but I have done nothing.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME]-[NAME] sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together.
TTC	Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none.
TTC	“True,” said he, “and fearful to reflect upon.
TTC	Oh dear no.
TTC	“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the [NAME], hanging by the chain.
TTC	“I feel,” said [NAME] [NAME], “as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”
TTC	[NAME] hear what he did?
TTC	“[NAME] and I have been there; but only casually.
TTC	“We have borne this a long time,” said [NAME] [NAME], turning her eyes again upon [NAME].
TTC	“For the truth.
TTC	I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate.
TTC	The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and [NAME] (almost wholly transferred to them by [NAME] [NAME]) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.
TTC	“What,” said [NAME] [NAME], varying his apostrophe after missing his mark--“what are you up to, [NAME]?”
TTC	private topics of uneasiness.
TTC	Make the best of your way.
TTC	“Buried how long?”  “Almost eighteen years.”
TTC	And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars.
TTC	Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason.
TTC	Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even [NAME]’s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter.
TTC	The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size.
TTC	O pity us, kind [NAME], and help us!
TTC	It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue.
TTC	There’d be two sides to it.
TTC	With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend!
TTC	It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with [NAME] [NAME]’s domestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
TTC	“Kill him!”
TTC	She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a [NAME] beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always.
TTC	I am stronger than you, I bless [NAME] for it.
TTC	But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you.
TTC	Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.
TTC	“What is it?” cried [NAME], affrighted.
TTC	It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
TTC	Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook.
TTC	When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, [NAME] laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.
TTC	The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it.
TTC	After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it.
TTC	“O me, O me!
TTC	“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.
TTC	“I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place.
TTC	The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
TTC	“Without it, can I not save you, [NAME] [NAME]?
TTC	His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for [NAME] and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.
TTC	Outside Tellson’s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house.
TTC	“I certainly have seen that.”
TTC	But he had married in [NAME]?
TTC	“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”
TTC	But, now I believe that the mark of the [NAME] [NAME] is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies.
TTC	Worse quarters than [NAME]’s wine-shop, could easily have been found in [NAME] for a provincial slave of that degree.
TTC	His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly.
TTC	That, [NAME] [NAME],” said [NAME] [NAME], wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir.
TTC	“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.
TTC	There is great force in that.
TTC	and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.
TTC	I had to pass through that part, to get at the other.
TTC	“What have you been, besides a messenger?”
TTC	“Are you dying for him?”
TTC	Her father’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
TTC	“I am sure of it.
TTC	“Oh father, father.
TTC	“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after him.
TTC	On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.
TTC	Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
TTC	It was impossible for [NAME] to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring [NAME].
TTC	We may know what it is.”
TTC	She lost her colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely.
TTC	Within a minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.
TTC	One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out.
TTC	“You cannot do your friend a better service.”
TTC	But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress.
TTC	Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through.
TTC	Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!’
TTC	I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty.
TTC	“Oh dear yes!
TTC	“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet.
TTC	“Why do you want to know?”
TTC	They both knew too well what it meant.
TTC	The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.
TTC	“What did you look at, so fixedly?”
TTC	They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance.
TTC	“What is it?”
TTC	In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, [NAME] passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
TTC	If you’ll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your business.”
TTC	“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it.”
TTC	All was subdued and quiet, and [NAME] was more at ease than she had been.
TTC	“Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?”
TTC	“The boy’s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me.
TTC	“Indeed!” said [NAME], with much indifference.
TTC	I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops.
TTC	If it wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to you, [NAME]), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of his mother; don’t blow upon that [NAME]’s [NAME]--do not do it, sir--and let that father go into the line of the [NAME] diggin’, and make amends for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin’ of ’em in with a will, and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe.
TTC	“You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden.
TTC	“I would recommend him to sacrifice it.
TTC	The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the mother of two children [NAME], this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The [NAME].
TTC	“Nothing that we do, is done in vain.
TTC	There were solitary patches of road on the way between [NAME] and [NAME], and [NAME] [NAME], mindful of foot-pads, always retained [NAME] for this service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.
TTC	“A compliment,” said the [NAME], “to the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
TTC	“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for [NAME]’s information?”
TTC	When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”
TTC	This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, “Who are they?”
TTC	“Your afflicted,  “[NAME].”
TTC	He added in his inward and pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way, I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”
TTC	Tea-time, and [NAME] [NAME] making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people.
TTC	As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could, the [NAME]-[NAME]--howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of [NAME] that day.
TTC	To be buried alive for eighteen years!”
TTC	The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this [NAME]; the gentleman’s, all negligent indifference; the peasant’s, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.
TTC	For I’m a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of [NAME].
TTC	You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”
TTC	And who among the company at [NAME]’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our [NAME], could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!
TTC	Forbid it, miss!
TTC	He made her another bow.
TTC	If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first [NAME]  “[NAME] bless her for her sweet compassion!”  CHAPTER [NAME].
TTC	“Don’t do it!” said [NAME] [NAME] looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife’s petitions.
TTC	But care, care, care!
TTC	He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets.
TTC	As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.
TTC	The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing.
TTC	The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky.
TTC	Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”
TTC	Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of [NAME].
TTC	From the [NAME] of the [NAME], through [NAME] and the whole [NAME], through the [NAME], the [NAME] of [NAME], and all society (except the scarecrows), the [NAME] [NAME] descended to the [NAME] [NAME]: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings.”
TTC	“I ask your pardon,” said the [NAME], in a subdued tone, after some moments.
TTC	It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled.
TTC	All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop.
TTC	I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me!
TTC	“_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice.
TTC	The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the [NAME]’s arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.
TTC	One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
TTC	[NAME] had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper.
TTC	The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few [NAME]’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box.
TTC	“I think in all respects.”
TTC	Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees.
TTC	For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.
TTC	Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest.
TTC	He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral.
TTC	It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands.
TTC	His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
TTC	Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:  “Drive him fast to his tomb.
TTC	He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action.
TTC	At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
TTC	I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives.”
TTC	The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to the garret.
TTC	Upon those, had followed [NAME]’s letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name.
TTC	he said, looking down at her with some curiosity.
TTC	“Him and his hooroars!
TTC	Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow, he got it down.
TTC	The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot.
TTC	“You don’t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”  answered [NAME], with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that.
TTC	He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work.
TTC	“Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”
TTC	She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as [NAME] and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.
TTC	The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate.
TTC	“Is there?” asked [NAME], vacantly.
TTC	There happened to be no customer in the shop but [NAME] [NAME], of the restless fingers and the croaking voice.
TTC	That night--it was the fourteenth of [NAME]--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to [NAME], explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to [NAME], and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding [NAME] and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.
TTC	for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”
TTC	“[NAME], I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”
TTC	His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of [NAME] to his lips, when he put it down.
TTC	A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.
TTC	There is no harm at all done.
TTC	“Nothing yet.”
TTC	Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him?
TTC	The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of [NAME].
TTC	[NAME] [NAME] was out in the night, before he knew where he was.
TTC	“‘I do not address her brother?’
TTC	This man, whom he had seen upon the [NAME], stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the [NAME], man and wife.
TTC	I have cast up the years of her age, year after year.
TTC	“What other?”  “Do _you_ ask, [NAME] [NAME]?”  “Yes.”
TTC	“You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said [NAME], with the greatest composure.
TTC	On this second day, [NAME] [NAME] saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them.
TTC	“No, you may[NAME].
TTC	“No thanks to you in [NAME], if she does.
TTC	The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”
TTC	He stopped there, and faced round.
TTC	They are in danger of denunciation by [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
TTC	When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were dead.”
TTC	“Then, why should I go there?”
TTC	Do you know me?”
TTC	“How many did they say?”
TTC	I don’t understand.”
TTC	The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction.
TTC	His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it.
TTC	I have saved him.”
TTC	And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.
TTC	And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since.
TTC	“As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”
TTC	Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young [NAME], in [NAME]-[NAME], [NAME], and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation.
TTC	[NAME], muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers.
TTC	What would you have?”
TTC	He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.
TTC	“Then say the prisoner.”
TTC	“One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of [NAME] (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the [NAME] for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour’s distance from my place of residence in the [NAME] of the [NAME] of [NAME], when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast.
TTC	That, if statues were decreed in [NAME], as in ancient [NAME] and [NAME], to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one.
TTC	“Decidedly.
TTC	The speaker who struck in, was [NAME] [NAME].
TTC	How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?
TTC	I-I learnt it here.
TTC	The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders.
TTC	Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”
TTC	If the thing were gone, my dear [NAME], might not the fear go with it?
TTC	Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin.
TTC	“[NAME] [NAME], have you seen the prisoner before?”
TTC	Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the [NAME] [NAME], and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go.
TTC	Then, he softly called, “Enter there!
